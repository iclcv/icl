    /// The ProcessMonitor class grants access to processes memory and CPU usage
    /** Since querying process specific information is not standardized in C++,
        Only a Linux solution is provided yet.

        \section SRC Source of the Information

        * The pid is obtained via getpid()
        * numThreads and memoryUsage is obtained by parsing /proc/self/stats
        * memoryUsage is obtained by reading a piped 'ps' processes output
        * since querying information an in particular waiting for 'ps' output
          takes some time, all the information is collected in a dedicated
          thread.
        * numCPUs is queried once at construction time by parsing /proc/processor
        * allCPU usage is also queried by parsing the piped 'ps' output

        \section CB Callbacks
        Since sometimes, an application wants to do something, when new information
        is available, a callback mechanism is provided as well. Simply register
        an icl::Function instance that is then called whenever a new set of
        data is available.
