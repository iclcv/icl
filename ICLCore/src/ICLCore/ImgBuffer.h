    /// Singelton class that provides access to reusable temporary images
    /** \section GEN General Information
        For global functions as those, provided by the ICLQuick module,
        it is a common problem that functions that return whole images
        always have to allocation new memory for those images. To avoid this,
        a globel function can <em>ask</em> the singelton ImgBuffer instance
        for a temporary image (using one of the ImgBuffer::get functions).
        This will return a pointer to an image whose memory is managed by the
        ImgBuffer class.

        \section HOW How Appropriate Images are Found
        ICL Images internally use SmartPtr instances to manage their channel
        data pointers. ImgBase instances can be <em>asked</em> whether they
        are <em>independent</em>, i.e. no other image does currently share
        the image data.

        The ImgBuffer does internally manage a list potentially reusable
        Img-Instances for each possible image depth.

        \subsection GET_1 get(void)
        If ImgBuffer::get<T>(void) is called, the ImgBuffer searches in the
        current buffer-list for depth-T for an image that is currently
        independent, i.e, the ImgBuffer itself holds the only reference to the
        images memory. If an independent image can be found, it is returned,
        otherwise a new image is added to the ImgBuffers internal buffer list
        for depth-T.

        \subsection GET_2 get(params)
        If ImgBuffer::get<T>(const ImgParams&) or
        ImgBuffer::get<T>(const Size&,int) is called, the ImgBuffer will first
        search for an image that is not only independent but that already has
        the desired parameters. If a compatible image is found, it is returned.
        Otherwise, an independent image is preferred. If an independent image
        can be found, it's parameters are adapted to the desired parameters.
        Otherwise, a new image with the desired parameters is created, stored
        and returned.
