    /// ImageRegion Structure providing region feature information \ingroup G_RD
    /** \section GEN General information
        The Region class provides several region information:
        - size (pixel count of the region
        - value (pixel value of the region; Currently each region is
          defined by connected Pixels with identical intensity values)
        - boundary (list of outer boundary pixels of the region, in several versions)
        - formfactor (normed ratio between image pixel size and boundary
          length)
        - cog (center of gravity of the region)
        - bounding box (outer bounding box of the region)
        - line segments (low level access to underlying list of line segments)
        - pixels (list of all region pixels)
        - local PCA information (angles and length of major axis')
        - (optionally) region-graph information: (what region contains which other regions)

        \section INT Internal Information
        Valid ImageRegion-instances are only created by a RegionDetector instance.


        \section DEF Deferred Calculation of Features
        Almost all features are computed on demand only. This means, that e.g. the center of
        gravity is only calculated if the corresponding getter-function getCOG() is called.
        The results of all features are automatically stored internally. By this means, all features
        must only be computed once, even if the corresponding getter function is called several times.

        \section GRAPH Region Graph Information
        Some ImageRegion features are only available if the parent RegionDetector was
        set up to compute so called region graph information. From this, an ImageRegion
        structure can compute the following features:
        * neighbour regions
        * sub regions
        * surrounding regions (parent region and parent region tree)

        If one of these functions is called in a case where no region graph information
        is available, an exception will be thrown.

        \section INT2 Internal Processing
        Most high level features, such as bounding boxes or PCA information,
        can be calculated efficiently on the underlying LineSegment structure.
        Only this list of boundary pixels are calculated on basis of the underlying image.

        \section CP Copying
        To avoid deep copies of internal region data, the ImageRegion is a very simple wrapper
        of an underlying data structure called ImageRegionData. Even though a pointer to this
        structure can be obtained using the ImageRegion::data() function, is is strongly recommended
        to use the ImageRegions interface only. Access to the internal structure is only for
        debugging.
