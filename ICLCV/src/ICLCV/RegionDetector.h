    /// Complex utility class for detection of connected image components \ingroup G_RD
    /** The RegionDetector extracts all connected components from a given input image

        \section NEIGHBOURHOOD Pixel Neighbourhood
        Currently, only a 4-Neighbourhood for pixels is supported. This means, that
        Image-Regions have to be adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Pixels
        with an identical value, that are only connected diagonally are not connected.

        \section DEPTHS Supported Image Depths
        As internally, adjacent pixels are compared using the default '==' processing
        of float- or double-images is currently not supported. Furthermore, it is
        also very uncommon to search for connected components on floating-point images.

        \section MULTI_CHANNEL Multi-Channel Images
        In short: multi-channel images are not supported at all. Strictly speaking
        only the channel with index 0 is used, all other remain untouched.

        \section ROI ROI Support
        ROI support is provided by the internally used instance of class
        RunLengthEncoder. The RunLengthEncoder has only a very small overhead for
        ROI-images. If an image with set ROI is passed to the RegionDetectors detect-
        function, only the images ROI is process internally. All other pixels will not
        be processed at all. In this case, regions, that are adjacent to the image
        ROI are set to be border-regions and image regions that intersect the ROI are
        cut at the ROI-boundaries.
        In other words, the detection behaves as if the image-ROI is extracted before
        the detection step.

        \section OWNERSHIP Image Ownership
        The RegionDetector instance does not take ownership of the given input image.
        However, the input image needs to remain unchanged as long as the
        result of the RegionDetector::detect-function is used. Currently, only the
        ImageRegions's ImageRegion::getBoundary() and variants of this method actually
        demand the image to be unchanged, however, future implementations of other
        feature functions of ImageRegion do not guarantee this.

        \section IMAGE_REGION The ImageRegion Structure
        The ImageRegion structure that is returned by the RegionDetector::detect-function
        Is a utility wrapper around it's data structure that is called ImageRegionData.
        Please do not use ImageRegionData directly, but only by using the ImageRegion
        interface. ImageRegions can easily be copied (just a single pointer copy) --
        the internal data is always managed by the parent RegionDetector instance.

        \section CONSTRAINTS Detection Constraints
        There are two direct constraints, that can be defined for filtering the set
        of all image regions:
        - size (minSize,maxSize) defines an interval for the pixel-count of valid regions.
        - value (minValue,maxValue) defines and interval for the pixel-value of valid regions

        <b>Note:</b> Internally, all regions are always detected and automatically filtered
        afterwards. By this means, RegionDetector::detect only returns regions, that
        match the given size and value constraints but also all neighbours and sub-regions
        of these are also available even if they do not match the filter criterion.

        \section REGION_GRAPH Region Graph Information
        RegionDetector provides the functionality to perform a simple connected component
        analysis as well as to compute higher level information about the region structure.
        In particular, it can be set up to create a so called <em>region graph</em>.
        Which defines basically, which regions are adjacent. This information can then
        be used to compute a region hierarchy that defines which regions do contain which
        other regions. The most expensive step is to define the region neighbours of each
        region. Therefore, the creation of this additinal information has to be activated
        explicitly. If the RegionDetector was not set up to create the region graph (either
        via a constructor argument or using the function
        RegionDetector::setCreateGraph(bool)), this information is not available, and
        the following region-information are not available:
        * region neighbours
        * sub-regions
        * parent regions

        \section ALGO The Algorithm
        We use a custom designed and highly optimized algorithm for connected component analysis.
        In a first step: The image is run-length encoded. All further steps are performed on
        the resulting LineSegment representation.

        The Algorithm is split into 6 parts:
        -# run length encoding
        -# region analysis (create region-parts)
        -# region joining (collect sup-parts of top-level parts in order to obtain regions)
        -# region linking (only if a region graph is created) set up region neighbours
        -# setting up border regions (only if a region graph is created)
        -# region filtering (filter regions by using given size and value constraint)
        -# further processing on individual regions

        \subsection RLE Run Length Encoding

        In a first preprocessing step, the input image is run length encoded. Each image line
        is then no longer represented as a set of <em>width</em> pixel values but as a
        sequence of so called LineSegments each defined by pixel value, x,y, and xend. For this step
        a RunLengthEncoder instances is used. Note, that run length encoding is highly
        optimized in case of using icl8u-images. Here, the most essential step (search for
        the first pixel value that is different from the current one) is accelerated by
        checking 4 next pixels at once.

        \subsection RA Region Analysis
        In this processing step, each 2 successive image lines (represented as sequences of
        LineSegments) are processed. Internally, we used a utility structure called
        WorkingLineSegment for run length encoding. This utility class can also hold additinal
        information which is a pointer to an ImageRegionPart in this step. If two
        line segments A and B with identical values are adjacent (using 4-neighbourhood),
        they are both added to A's ImageRegionPart and B's ImageRegionPart is set to
        A's ImageRegionPart. Occasionally, A and B are already set up with an ImageRegionPart.
        In this case, B's ImageRegionPart is added to A's ImageRegionPart and B's
        ImageRegionPart is set to be no longer on top level. Only top level ImageRegionParts
        are transformed to complete image regions in the next step.\n
        After this step, we have a set of ImageRegionParts. Some of this parts are still top
        level, others are not and need to be added to their top-most ImageRegionPart.

        \subsection JO Region Joining
        Here, a ImageRegion (stricly speaking ImageRegionData-structure) is created from
        each top level ImageRegionParts T. During the creation process, all
        WorkingLineSegments of T and all contained ImageRegionParts are collected recursively.
        Furthermore, the internally used WorkingLineSegments do no longer
        need information about their parent ImageRegionPart. Therefore, their data pointer
        is set to their parent ImageRegionData structure.\n
        After this step, we already have a set of all image regions.

        \subsection LINKING Region Linking
        If a region graph needs to be created, this step is used to detect which regions
        are adjacent. Again, we use the internal WorkingLineSegment representation. For
        each pair adjacent WorkingLineSegments A and B (4-neighbourhood) A's linked
        ImageRegionData is set to be a neighbour of B's ImageRegionData and vice versa.
        After this step, each ImageRegionData contains a set of all of it's adjacent
        ImageRegionData structures.

        \subsection BORDERS Setting up Border Regions
        For the computation of region containment, regions that are adjacent to the image
        borders are special as these regions are not contained by other regions. Here,
        we again use the internal WorkingLineSegment representation to set up the
        isBorder-flag of all ImageRegionData structures that touch the image border to true.

        \subsection FILTERING Filtering Regions
        Lastly, all ImageRegionData structures are filtered w.r.t. the given size and
        value constraints.
