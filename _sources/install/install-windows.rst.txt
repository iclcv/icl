Installation Instructions for Windows
#####################################

ICL can be downloaded as source code via SVN or as binary package (soon).
Please refer to the :ref:`download instructions<download>` for details.
ICL uses standard CMake as its build system (for more details on CMake visit
http://www.cmake.org/).
ICL comes with only very few installation dependencies. We decided
to make a small set of dependencies compulsory in order to limit
the set of possible combinations.



Table of Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* :ref:`install.win.dependencies`

  * :ref:`install.win.dependencies.mandatory`

* :ref:`install.win.binary`


.. _install.win.dependencies:

External Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most external dependencies are kept purely optional. There are only few
mandatory dependencies and most are delivered by the ICL.

.. _install.win.dependencies.mandatory:

Mandatory Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **pthreads** (for general threading support)
* **zlib** (for reading and writing zipped files, ending .gz)
* **libjpeg** (for reading and writing jpeg images,
  lossy but high compression, fast)
* **libpng** (for reading and writing png images,
  loss-less compression, but rather slow in comparison to jpeg)

In Windows you only need to get libpthread. All other mandatory libraries are
provided by the ICL. libpthread can be downloaded on the following website:

* https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/


.. _install.win.dependencies.doc:

Dependencies for the Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to create the documentation of ICL and this manual you need to
install some tools:

* **Python 2.7.x**
* **pyparsing**
* **Sphinx**
* **Doxygen**

You can get Python on the following website:

* http://python.org/download/

After installing Python it is recommended to add the Python and Python/Scripts
directory to the environment variable **PATH**. For an easy installation of
**pyparsing** and **Sphinx** download setuptools here:

* https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py

Using the command prompt browse to the directory with the previously
downloaded file and run the following commands to install **setuptools**,
**pyparsing** and **Sphinx**::

python ez_setup.py
easy_install pyparsing
easy_install sphinx

Now you only need **Doxygen** which can be found here:

* http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional:

Optional Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In general each optional dependency adds some extra functionality to ICL. In
some of the cases, also a slower but native fallback implementation is
provided. In the following, the external dependencies are listed and their
benefits are explained.

.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.ipp:

Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Intel IPP is a proprietary library that provides a very large set
of highly optimized functions for different domains, such as linear
algebra and in particular computer-vision and image
processing. **Important:** Since Intel IPP is proprietary software,
Intel IPP linkage must be established by manually compiling ICL from
source. However, we plan to replace the static linkage against Intel
IPP with a run-time linking approach that would also work for binary
installation sources.

* **Supported Versions:**
* **License Type:** Proprietary, but free to try and for private use
  (research is not private)
* **Download at:** http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-ipp/
* **Dependent library features:** Most low-level image processing
  functions such as scaling, converting and linear filters are
  internally replaced by highly efficient Intel IPP function calls.
  The :icl:`filter::ProximityOp` filters are not available without Intel
  IPP yet (but we plan to add fallback implementations soon).


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.mkl:

Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Intel Math Kernel Library dependency is quite similar to the Intel
IPP dependency. However, Intel MKL is only used for a much smaller set
of linear algebra functions. Global mathematical utility functions
such as :icl:`math::big_matrix_mult_t` or :icl:`DynMatrix::big_matrix_pinv`
significantly accelerated if Intel MKL is available. However, in
contrast to the Intel IPP dependency, all MKL-accelerated functions
have an equivalent C++ fallback implementation.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 10.3
* **License Type:** Proprietary, but free to try and for private use
  (research is not private)
* **Download at:** http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/
* **Dependent library features:** Accelerated functions for big
  matrices, most of them located in :icl:`DynMatrixUtils.h`


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.opencv:

Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use OpenCV mainly in order to provide a compatibility interface
that converts OpenCV's common image data type **cv::Mat** into ICL's image type
:icl:`core::ImgBase` and vice versa.
The header :icl:`OpenCV.h` in the ICLCore module provides efficient and simple
to use converter methods. These are only available if the OpenCV
dependency is met. In addition, OpenCV is currently needed for the
LibOpenSurf (http://www.chrisevansdev.com/computer-vision-opensurf.html)
based backend of the :icl:`cv::SurfFeatureDetector` which is directly
part of ICL.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 2.1
* **License Type:** BSD-License
* **Download at:** http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files
* **Dependent library features:**

  * Data type conversions
  * C++-based surf feature detection
  * OpenCV-based camera grabber backend
  * OpenCV-based video grabber backend
  * Video-writer backend
  * intrinsic camera calibration tool


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.libmesasr:

SwissRanger Driver Library (libMesaSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LibMesaSR is a proprietary library that allows to grab images from
SwissRanger 3D time-of-flight cameras provided by the Mesa Imaging
company (http://www.mesa-imaging.ch) The library is closed source.

* **License Type:** Proprietary
* **Download at:** http://www.mesa-imaging.ch/drivers.php
* **Dependent library features:** SwissRanger camera grabber backend


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.imagemagick:

Image Magick (libmagick++)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ImageMagick is used to provide a large set of support image types. Most
types are supported in both reading and writing. Without ImageMagick, only
a few image data types are supported: .ppm, .pnm and .pgm as well as ICL's
internal image format .bicl are natively supported, .png and .jpg are
supported explicitly by other external dependencies.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 1.0.14
* **License Type:** Proprietary
* **Download at:** http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
* **Dependent library features:** huge set of image reading and writing backends


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.libdc:

libdc1394
~~~~~~~~~

The dc1394 (digital firewire camera) library allows to grab image from
firewire cameras and to set camera parameters.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 2.1.2
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/
* **Dependent library features:** firewire camera grabber backend


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.libfreenect:

OpenKinect Kinect Driver Library (libfreenect)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The libfreenect provides a lightweight interface for grabbing images
from Microsoft Kinect cameras. The library allows to grab color, depth and
IR-images and to set some internal camera properties.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 0.0.1
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
* **Dependent library features:** libfreenect-based access to Kinect cameras
  (Please note, that we also provide an alternative using OpenNI)


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.xine:

Xine (libxine)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The xine library provides a very intuitive yet powerful interface for
grabbing video in a frame-by-frame manner.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 1.1.17
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://www.xine-project.org/home
* **Dependent library features:** xine-based video grabber backend
  (Please note, that we also provide an alternative using OpenCV)


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.qt:

Qt Library (libQt5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The well known Qt Library is used for ICL's rapid GUI creation toolkit.
Actually Qt is also a prerequisite for most ICL applications and for
the whole ICLQt module. We strongly recommend to have at least Qt support
when building ICL. The Qt package right now also used the OpenGL extension
wrangler library Glew and it needs OpenGL headers to be installed.

* **Supported Versions:** 5
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://qt.digia.com/
* **Dependent library features:**

  * GUI-framework and all dependent applications
  * Shared memory based image-I/O backends


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.pylon:

Basler Pylon Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The closed source basler pylon drivers (including the Genicam libraries) are
used for accessing Gigabit-Ethernet (GIG-E) cameras.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 2.3.3
* **License Type:** closed source
* **Download at:** http://www.baslerweb.com/Downloads-Software-43868.html
* **Dependent library features:** Pylon grabber backend for GIG-E Cameras


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.opencl:

Open Computing Language (OpenCL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenCL is used to significantly speed up a set of processing units using
the computing units of graphics cards or other OpenCL platforms. We mainly use it
for point cloud processing units located in the ICLGeom module.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 1.1 (1.2 soon)
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl
* **Dependent library features:**

  * significantly faster point cloud creation and RGBD-mapping
    (:icl:`geom::PointCloudCreator`, :icl:`geom::DepthCameraBasedPointCloudGrabber`)
  * significantly faster point cloud normal estimation and segmentation
    (:icl:`geom::PointCloudNormalEstimator`)


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.openni:

OpenNI / Nite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right now, we only use OpenNI as an alternative backend to grab images
from Kinect and other PrimeSense 3D cameras

* **Supported Versions:** >= 1.x
* **License Type:** OpenNI: open source, Nite: closed source
* **Download at:** http://www.openni.org/
* **Dependent library features:** OpenNI-based grabber backend for depth, IR- and color images


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.pcl:

Point Cloud Library (PCL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PCL has become some kind of a quasi-standard for point cloud
processing. ICL's ICLGeom module provides the generic
:icl:`geom::PointCloudObjectBase` interface that is implemented by the
:icl:`geom::PCLPointCloudObject` class. In case of having PCL support,
ICL can seamlessly interface to PCL algorithms using this class.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 1.6
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://pointclouds.org/downloads/
* **Dependent library features:**

  * :icl:`geom::PCLPointCloudObject` class.
  * :icl:`geom::PCDFileGrabber` class

.. todo::

   There is an unsolved dependency between PCL and OpenNI, since
   our PCD-File Grabber uses libpcl-io, which in turn depends on
   openni.


.. _install.win.dependencies.optional.rsb:

Robotics Service Bus (RSB)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The robotics service bus is a new and versatile library for
interprocess communications. ICL uses it as backends for the
:icl:`io::GenericGrabber` and the :icl:`io::GenericImageOutput` to
exchange image data between different processes and PCs.

* **Supported Versions:** >= 0.7
* **License Type:** open source
* **Download at:** http://docs.cor-lab.de//rsb-manual/0.10/html/index.html
* **Dependent library features:** rsb-based image I/O backends


.. _install.win.source:

Installation from Source
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Before you can install the ICL you need to get some tools:

* **Subversion:** http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
* **Visual Studio:** http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs
* **CMake:** http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Then you can open your command window and check out the source files::

   svn co https://opensource.cit-ec.de/svn/icl/trunk ICL

In CMake you have to choose the directory with the ICL files and the build
destination. By clicking on the Configure button you have to specify the
generator. In our case it is Visual Studio. In addition you have the choice
between a 32 bit and 64 bit compiler. By confirming the selection you get a
list with the configuration options for the project.

.. note::
   If you use external libraries of a specific Visual Studio version, you
   have to choose the same compiler or you may experience wrong behaviour
   while using the ICL.

Every time you change one of the options you have to update the settings by
clicking on the Configure button again. In case of an error CMake will show it
in its output window. A red message means that the progression cannot go
further.

.. image:: /install/images/notfound.png

Now you have to configure at least the path to the Pthreads folder, if it
is not detected automatically. This can be done by choosing the root directory
with the library and the include files by setting the variable
**PTHREADS_ROOT**. Another way is to select the Pthreads library
**PTHREADS_pthreadVC2_LIBRARY** and the include directory
**PTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR** directly.

.. image:: /install/images/pthreads_dir.png

Every other option in the list is optional. By adding more libraries you have
to do the same as with Pthreads after updating the configuration. At the end
you have to use the Generate Button in order to create the project files.

In the build folder you will find the file **ICL.sln** you can use to open
the project with Visual Studio. If you start the project you should select the
configuration type first. In addition you have the choice to create **Debug**
or **Release** binaries.

.. image:: /install/images/release.png

In order to compile the binaries you have to build the project **ALL_BUILD**.
If you want to create the documentation and the manual you have to build the
projects **doc** and **manual** explicitly.

You can use the project **INSTALL** to copy all generated files, which are
needed for your own projects, into the installation directory. This folder
is selected during the CMake configuration.

At this point it is recommended to add an environment variable with the ICL
installation folder and the directory with the created Dynamic-link Libraries
(DLL's) to your system path. For an easy access to the ICL installation
folder add the environment variable **ICL_DIR** with the directory of the ICL.
This can be done with the following line in the command prompt::

   setx -m ICL_DIR INSTALL_DIR

Here **INSTALL_DIR** is the path to the folder containing the installed files.

Applications which are using the ICL need an access to the ICL libraries. The
nasty way is to put the DLL's and the application executable in the same
folder. By adding the directory of the DLL's to the system variable **PATH**
you will avoid the previously mentioned solution. This variable defines
directories where an application can search for missing libraries.


.. _install.win.binary:

Installaion using Binary Packages
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Binary packages are not yet supported, but we plan to support this as
soon as possible.
