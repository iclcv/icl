      For each link that is created on the paper, the minimum intersected
      stiffness value is used. By these means, all constraints, that intersect
      fold lines are weak.

      For memorization, an extra mechanism was implemented. Memorized links
      (of first-order-type) will have a negative stiffness entry in the fold map.

      A bending constraint gets a either a  potitive stiffness value or, if
      all stiffness values were 1 (i.e. no non-memorized fold was intersected),
      but it crosses a memorized (<0) link, it gets the memorization property.
