# Raytracing — Continuation Guide

## Current State (Session 6 — PBR Material System)

### What Was Built

Full real-time path tracing pipeline with hardware-accelerated BVH on Apple
Silicon, MetalFX upscaling, GPU-native denoising (À-Trous + SVGF), tone mapping,
emissive area light sampling, XML scene loading, and an offline renderer for
visual verification — all with a modular backend architecture.

**Architecture:**
```

  │
  ▼
GeometryExtractor ── tessellate → triangles, per-vertex normals, dirty tracking,
  │                   emissive triangle list (area light sampling)
  ▼
SceneRaytracer ── orchestration, backend auto-selection, camera change detection
  │
  ├──▶ CpuRTBackend     ── SAH BVH, OpenMP, path tracing, FXAA, adaptive AA
  ├──▶ OpenCLRTBackend   ── same BVH on GPU, multi-pass PT within fps budget
  └──▶ MetalRTBackend    ── hardware BVH via Metal RT (intersect<>), Apple Silicon
       │
       ▼
  Post-processing pipeline (virtual stages):
    applyDenoisingStage()    ── GPU: À-Trous / SVGF  │ CPU fallback: all methods
    applyToneMappingStage()  ── GPU: all curves       │ CPU fallback: all curves
    applyUpsamplingStage()   ── GPU: MetalFX          │ CPU fallback: bilinear/edge-aware
```

**Backend capability negotiation:**
```
supportsNativeDenoising(method)   → Metal: ATrous, SVGF
supportsNativeToneMapping(method) → Metal: Reinhard, ACES, Hable
supportsNativeUpscaling(method)   → Metal: MetalFX Spatial, MetalFX Temporal
supportsDenoising(method)         → native OR CPU fallback available?
```

### Key Design Decisions (Session 5)

**Virtual post-processing stages:**
- `applyDenoisingStage()`, `applyToneMappingStage()`, `applyUpsamplingStage()` are
  virtual methods in the base class. Default: CPU fallback. Metal backend overrides
  for GPU-native paths.
- `supportsNativeDenoising()` / `supportsNativeToneMapping()` / `supportsNativeUpscaling()`
  let the UI/orchestrator query capabilities at runtime.
- Pipeline order: raytrace → denoise → tone map → upscale → readback.

**SVGF temporal design:**
- The path tracer does its own temporal accumulation (running average over N frames).
- SVGF does NOT blend colors temporally — it passes the accumulated color through
  unchanged. It only tracks luminance moments (mean, mean²) across frames for
  per-pixel variance estimation.
- The spatial filter uses this variance to adapt edge-stopping weights (σ_lum scales
  with √variance), giving better quality than plain À-Trous.
- Mesh ID edge-stopping: hard `continue` for neighbors with different object IDs
  prevents silhouette halos from path tracing jitter at object boundaries.

**Reflectivity-aware denoising:**
- Per-pixel `mat.reflectivity` output from raytrace kernels.
- Spatial filter weight scaled by `(1-refl)²` — mirrors get minimal spatial blur.
- Applied in both GPU and CPU SVGF implementations.

**Emissive area light sampling:**
- `RTEmissiveTriangle` list built during scene extraction with world-space vertices,
  smooth averaged vertex normals (not cross-product face normals), and triangle area.
- One random triangle per bounce, area-weighted selection, uniform barycentric point.
- Shadow ray: `max_distance = dist - 1.0` to avoid self-intersection.
- Geometric term: `NdotL * lightNdotL * totalEmissiveArea / dist²`.

**Tone mapping:**
- Reinhard, ACES filmic (Narkowicz 2015), Hable/Uncharted 2 curves.
- Exposure multiplier applied before the curve.
- No gamma correction (raytracer output is already in display space).
- Metal GPU kernel operates in-place on float buffers.

**XML scene loader:**
- Composable: `render-offline -scene base.xml objects.xml` merges files.
  First camera wins, lights/objects accumulate.
- Supports: camera, lights (with scale), cube/sphere objects with color,
  reflectivity, shininess, emission, rotation, scale.
- Uses ICL's pugixml wrapper (`ICLUtils/XML.h`).

# Circle shadow test
./bin/render-offline -scene scenes/circle-test.xml -pt -frames 512 -o shadows.png
```

### Bugs Fixed (Session 5)

1. **MetalFX RG16Float** — pixel format constant was 102, correct value is 105
2. **MetalFX Temporal depth format** — requires `Depth32Float` (252), not `R32Float`
3. **MetalFX Temporal jitter** — Halton jitter must be applied to camera rays before
   dispatch, not just reported to the scaler
4. **1D kernel dispatch** — u8ToFloat/floatToU8/toneMap kernels changed from 1D (n,1)
   to 2D (w,h) dispatch with uint2 tid (1D caused all-black on some configs)
5. **SVGF + tone mapping crash** — SVGF temporal buffers need separate size tracking
   (svgfW/H) from shared denoise ping-pong buffers (denoiseW/H)
6. **Tone mapping gamma** — removed incorrect pow(1/2.2) gamma; output is already
   display-space
7. **SVGF double accumulation** — path tracer accumulates, SVGF passes color through;
   only tracks variance temporally
8. **Silhouette halo** — mesh ID edge-stopping in spatial filter prevents color bleeding
   across object boundaries from path tracing jitter
9. **Emissive shadow artifacts** — use averaged smooth vertex normals instead of
   cross-product face normals for emissive triangles

### Material System (Session 6)

**Phase 1 — Material class + SceneObject integration:**
- `ICLGeom/src/ICLGeom/Material.h/.cpp` — PBR `Material` class with `baseColor`,
  `metallic`, `roughness`, `reflectivity`, `emissive`, texture map slots
  (`baseColorMap`, `normalMap`, `metallicRoughnessMap`, `emissiveMap` as
  `shared_ptr<ImgBase>`), alpha mode, display hints. Static factories
  `fromColor()`, `fromPhong()`, plus `toPhongParams()` for GL fallback.
- `Primitive.h` — `shared_ptr<Material> material` on base Primitive struct
- `SceneObject.h/.cpp` — `m_defaultMaterial`, `setMaterial()`/`getMaterial()` API,
  `getOrCreateMaterial()`. Old `setColor`/`setShininess`/`setSpecularReflectance`/
  `setReflectivity`/`setEmission` deprecated with `[[deprecated]]` — still work,
  auto-sync to material.

**Phase 2 — Raytracer PBR shading:**
- `RTMaterial` updated: `baseColor`, `emissive`, `metallic`, `roughness`,
  `reflectivity` (replaces diffuseColor/specularColor/shininess)
- `GeometryExtractor` reads from Material class when available, legacy fallback
- Cook-Torrance microfacet BRDF (GGX + Smith + Schlick Fresnel) in all three
  backends: CPU, Metal, OpenCL. Energy-conserving Lambert diffuse for dielectrics,
  zero diffuse for metals.

**Phase 3 — OpenGL renderer adaptation:**
- `Scene::renderSceneObjectRecursive()` uses `Material::toPhongParams()` for GL state
- Per-primitive material override in render loop (set/restore GL specular/shininess)

**Phase 4 — Texture support:**
- `Material` stores textures as `shared_ptr<core::ImgBase>` (portable, no Qt dep)
- `RTVertex` extended with `float u, v` (UV coordinates)
- `SceneObject` gets `m_texCoords` vector, `addTexCoord()`/`getTexCoords()`
- `GeometryExtractor` flows UVs through: from per-vertex texCoords, or generates
  (0,0)→(1,1) for TexturePrimitive quads
- `RaytracerBackend::setMaterialTextures()` virtual passes Material pointers
- CPU backend samples all four texture maps at hit UVs:
  - `baseColorMap` → modulates albedo
  - `metallicRoughnessMap` → overrides metallic (R) and roughness (G)
  - `normalMap` → perturbs shading normal via tangent-space transform
  - `emissiveMap` → modulates emission
- GPU texture sampling deferred (Metal/OpenCL need texture upload infrastructure)

**Key design decisions (Session 6):**
- Texture images stored as `ImgBase` (not `GLImg`) for portability across backends
- PBR↔Phong conversion in both directions preserves visual appearance
- Deprecated API auto-creates Material on first use via `getOrCreateMaterial()`
- Per-primitive material override: primitive's material > object's material > legacy
- Normal map uses constructed tangent frame from shading normal (no explicit tangents)

### Session 6 additional improvements

- **Roughness-aware SVGF denoising** — roughness passed through G-buffer alongside
  reflectivity. Spatial filter scales neighbor weights by `roughness²`: smooth
  surfaces get almost no blur (preserves specular highlights), rough surfaces get
  full denoising. Combined with reflectivity via `min(reflScale, roughScale)`.
- **Specular indirect lighting** — path tracer now does MIS between specular and
  diffuse bounces (was diffuse-only). Metals get ~90% specular bounces with
  roughened reflection direction. Fixes metals appearing flat/matte.
- **Brighter sky gradient** — warm horizon (0.6) → blue zenith (0.55), dark below
  horizon. Essential for PBR materials to have something to reflect.
- **Material extraction bug fix** — RTMaterial fields were uninitialized when
  `geomDirty=false`, corrupting all materials on geometry change. Fixed by always
  extracting material via `tessellateExtractMaterial()` + adding default initializers
  to RTMaterial fields.
- **Demo improvements** — PBR material archetypes (roughness gradient, gold, copper,
  plastic, rubber, mirror, emissive), material tooltip on hover, improved physics
  parameters (lower angular damping, initial spin for realistic tumbling).

### Known issues with custom raytracer

The custom Cook-Torrance BRDF implementation has visual quality limitations:
- **Roughness differences barely visible for dielectrics** — F0=0.04 means only 4%
  specular, dwarfed by diffuse. Needs HDR environment maps (not just a sky gradient)
  to show glossy reflections convincingly.
- **Metals look better after specular indirect fix** but still not production quality.
- **Denoiser vs roughness tension** — SVGF spatial filter still erases subtle specular
  differences despite roughness-aware edge-stopping.
- **No importance-sampled GGX** — specular indirect uses roughened reflection
  approximation, not proper GGX importance sampling.

These limitations motivated the decision to integrate Blender Cycles instead.

## Cycles Integration (Session 6 — In Progress)

### Decision

Replace the custom raytracing backends with Blender Cycles as the rendering engine.
Cycles provides production-quality PBR (Principled BSDF), Metal GPU acceleration,
OIDN denoising, environment maps, and 15+ years of battle-tested code.

### Build Status

Cycles standalone is checked out at `3rdparty/cycles/` and builds successfully.
See `3rdparty/cycles/INSTALL_ICL.md` for build instructions.

**Prerequisites (macOS):**
```bash
brew install git-lfs python@3.13
```

**Build:**
```bash
cd 3rdparty/cycles
make update                    # ~1.2 GB precompiled deps via Git LFS
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPYTHON_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13 \
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/libpython3.13.dylib \
  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/include/python3.13
cmake --build . -j16 --target install
```

**Verified:** Metal and CPU devices detected, `install/cycles` executable built.

### Cycles XML Shader Node Issue — FIXED (Session 7)

The standalone `cycles` executable had a **lazy initialization problem**: most
shader node types failed with "Unknown shader node" errors because `NODE_DEFINE`
only registers a node type when `get_node_type()` is explicitly called, but the
XML parser calls `NodeType::find()` which does a plain map lookup. In full Blender,
the UI code constructs every node type (triggering registration); the standalone
never did. **Not a linker issue** — the code was linked, just never called.

**Fix:** Added `xml_register_shader_nodes()` in `src/app/cycles_xml.cpp` — a
bootstrap function that calls `get_node_type()` on all 90 concrete shader node
classes before XML parsing starts. Called at the top of `xml_read_file()`.

**Verified:** All example scenes render correctly — `sky_texture`, `background`,
`checker_texture`, `glass_bsdf`, `noise_texture`, `glossy_bsdf`, `diffuse_bsdf`,
`wave_texture`, `bump`, `emission`, etc. all work.

### Cycles Integration Progress

1. ~~**Fix shader node registration**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7)
2. ~~**Verify full rendering**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7)
3. ~~**CMake + Cycles linking**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — `cycles_target_setup()` helper
4. ~~**CyclesRenderer + SceneSynchronizer**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — full bridge:
   - ICL Scene → Cycles scene (meshes, materials, camera, lights)
   - PrincipledBsdf shader graphs from ICL Material
   - ICL Camera intrinsics → Cycles FOV
   - Per-object dirty tracking for incremental updates
   - OutputDriver → ICL Img8u with sRGB gamma
   - Quality presets (Preview/Interactive/Final)
5. ~~**Delete old infrastructure**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — removed ~9,870 lines
6. ~~**Analytic spheres**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — SceneObject::ObjectType::Sphere
   renders via Cycles PointCloud (perfect ray-sphere intersection, zero faceting)
7. ~~**Camera crash fix**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — removed `cclCam->update()` call
   that caused SIGBUS; Session::reset() handles it. FOV/clip plane clamping added.
8. ~~**Hosek-Wilkie sky**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — realistic environment lighting
   via SkyTextureNode, proper light intensity scaling for scene units

### Camera Orientation Issue (IN PROGRESS — Session 7)

The camera orientation conversion from ICL to Cycles is partially working but
has a subtle Y-axis flip problem related to ICL's unconventional `up` vector:

**ICL Camera convention** (from Camera.h docs):
- `norm` = view direction (the direction the camera looks)
- `up` = direction pointing toward **positive image Y**, which is the **bottom**
  of the image (image Y increases downward). This is opposite to most 3D APIs
  where "up" means scene-up / image-top.
- `horiz` = computed as `cross(up, norm)`, forms right-handed system with norm and up

**Current state of syncCamera (SceneSynchronizer.cpp):**
- `camUp = -icl_up` (negated, since ICL up points down)
- `right = cross(forward, camUp)`
- `upVec = cross(right, forward)`
- Cycles transform: `tfm.y = -upVec` (negated Y row)
- OutputDriver: no Y-flip (direct copy)

**What works:** Y-up scenes with `Camera::lookAt()` render correctly
(`cycles-renderer-test` shows spheres on ground, right-side up, correct FOV).

**What doesn't work:** Z-up scenes (physics demo). The camera at
`(600, -500, 400)` looking at `(0, 0, -30)` with `up=(0,0,1)` shows only sky.
The camera orientation math produces a valid-looking matrix but the objects
aren't in the field of view.

**`Camera::lookAt()` factory** (added in Session 7, in Camera.h/.cpp):
- Takes intuitive params: position, target, up, resolution, hfov_degrees
- Computes `norm = normalize(target - position)`
- Computes `imageUp` = component of world-up perpendicular to norm
- Derives `f` and `mx` from desired horizontal FOV
- Sets `principalPointOffset` to image center
- Works for Y-up; untested/broken for Z-up

**Key insight still needed:** The relationship between ICL's `up` vector,
the Cycles Transform rows, and the OutputDriver's Y-flip needs to be resolved
as a single coherent convention. The current approach of individual negations
and flips is fragile. Consider studying how the old GeometryExtractor's
`extractCamera` built the ray generation matrix — it worked for both Y-up
and Z-up scenes. That code is in git history at commit 47ee811d0.

**Debug aids in place:**
- `fprintf(stderr, "[Camera] ...")` prints in syncCamera showing pos, fwd, up,
  fov, near/far, and the full 3x4 transform matrix. Remove when fixed.

### Completed (Session 8)

- ✅ Camera orientation fixed for Y-up and Z-up (horiz, -up, forward as columns)
- ✅ Camera::lookAt documented with ICL's unusual up=visual-down convention
- ✅ Light intensity calibrated (300x multiplier for ICL scene distances)
- ✅ Non-blocking progressive rendering (3-state machine: IDLE→WAIT_FOR_START→RENDERING)
- ✅ tag_update(scene) for transform changes (was tag_tfm_modified which was a no-op)
- ✅ session->start() after every session->reset() (session thread goes idle after completion)
- ✅ Physics demo: time-based spawning, delayed object activation, side-by-side GL view
- ✅ Scene viewer: OBJ loading, auto-scale, checkerboard ground, material presets
- ✅ Vertex clustering mesh decimation (-decimate N)
- ✅ renderBlocking() for offscreen rendering

### Next Steps — File Format Support & Textures

#### Phase 1: glTF/GLB Loader (Priority)

**Goal:** Load complex textured models (cars, characters, architectural scenes).
glTF is the modern standard — single GLB file bundles meshes + PBR materials + textures.

**Available:** `cgltf.h` single-header C parser already in `3rdparty/cycles/lib/macos_arm64/materialx/include/MaterialXRender/External/Cgltf/cgltf.h`

**Implementation plan:**
1. Create `ICLExperimental/Raytracing/src/Raytracing/GltfLoader.h/.cpp`
2. Parse GLB/glTF using cgltf: meshes → SceneObject, materials → Material, textures → ImgBase
3. Handle: vertex positions, normals, UVs, indices, PBR metallic-roughness materials
4. Handle: embedded textures (base64 or binary chunk), external texture references
5. Create camera from glTF camera nodes (if present)
6. Wire into cycles-scene-viewer: `-scene model.glb`

**Key mapping:** glTF PBR → ICL Material (already compatible):
- baseColorFactor → Material::baseColor
- metallicFactor → Material::metallic
- roughnessFactor → Material::roughness
- emissiveFactor → Material::emissive
- baseColorTexture → Material::baseColorMap (as ImgBase)
- normalTexture → Material::normalMap
- metallicRoughnessTexture → Material::metallicRoughnessMap

#### Phase 2: Texture Support in Cycles Sync

**Goal:** Forward ICL Material texture maps to Cycles ImageTextureNode.

**Implementation plan:**
1. Create `ICLImageLoader` subclass of `ccl::ImageLoader` in SceneSynchronizer
2. Override `load_pixels()` to copy from ICL's `ImgBase` to Cycles' image buffer
3. In `createPrincipledShader()`: if material has baseColorMap, create ImageTextureNode
   connected to PrincipledBsdf's BaseColor input
4. Same for normalMap → Normal input, metallicRoughnessMap → Metallic/Roughness
5. Need UV coordinates: extend GeometryExtractor to pass `ATTR_STD_UV` from SceneObject's texCoords

**Cycles API for textures:**
```cpp
ImageTextureNode *tex = graph->create_node<ImageTextureNode>();
tex->set_filename(ustring("inline_image"));  // triggers ImageLoader
// Register the ICLImageLoader with the ImageManager
scene->image_manager->add_image(loader, ...);
```

#### Phase 3: Cycles XML Scene Loader (Low Priority)

**Goal:** Load Cycles' native XML format for testing against reference scenes.
The standalone `cycles` executable already renders these — useful for validation.

**Available:** `3rdparty/cycles/src/app/cycles_xml.cpp` contains the full XML parser.
Could either: (a) call it directly from our code, or (b) port scenes to glTF.

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Deferred)

- **QEM mesh decimation** — Quadric Error Metrics for quality-preserving simplification
- **HDR environment maps** — `setBackground(filename)` API loading .hdr/.exr
- **Area/spot/sun lights** — extend syncLights beyond point lights
- **LOD system** — pre-compute 3-4 levels, switch by camera distance
- **Glass/transmission** — add `transmissionWeight` to Material for glass BSDF

### Test Models

**OBJ (working now):**
- Stanford bunny: `scenes/bunny.obj` (35K verts)
- More at: github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models (dragon, buddha, teapot)

**glTF/GLB (Phase 1 target):**
- Sketchfab: thousands of free downloadable GLB models (cars, characters, scenes)
- glTF sample models: github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets
  - DamagedHelmet.glb — textured PBR, good first test
  - FlightHelmet.glb — complex multi-material
  - Sponza.glb — architectural interior, stress test

### Known Limitations

- No texture mapping yet (Material textures not forwarded to Cycles)
- Lights created once per session (no dynamic light position updates in Cycles)
- Only point lights (no spot/area/sun)
- OIDN denoising too slow for interactive use
- Vertex clustering decimation is crude (QEM would preserve features better)
- OBJ loader: no MTL material parsing (uses default material)
- No glass/transmission material support
