    /// Class for fast LUT-based color segmentation
    /** \section GEN General Information
        Color segmentation is a very common issue in computer vision applications. The ColorSegmentationOp
        class implements a common and very efficient LUT based segmentation algorithm. It can be used
        to apply any possible segmentation where the classification of one pixel is only influenced by that
        pixels color value


        \section ALGO The Segmentation Algorithm

        Please consider an input color image I. In a first step, I is converted into depth8u and
        the specified segmentation-color-format (this can be set in the constructor or with the
        corresponding setter-function ColorSegmentationOp::setSegmentationFormat). This conversion
        is skipped if the given image parameters are already correct. Now, every pixel pI = (A,B,C)
        (e.g. if the segmentation format is formatRGB, pI=(R,G,B)) is classified by applying
        a lookup transformation on it. Basically, we use a lookup table of the whole segmentation
        color space for this. This implies that size of the lookup table becomes 256*256*256. In order
        to reduce the amount of cache misses when picking elements of this 16MB LUT, it is possible
        to adjust the number of bits that are used for each color channel. In the example above,
        8 bits (256 values) are used. If the number of bits are shifted (using the constructors
        channel-shift parameters or the setter function ColorSegmentationOp::setSegmentationShifts),
        the size of the lookup table becomes smaller and therefore, the lookup operation becomes
        faster (see \ref BENCH).
        Another advantage of using the channel-shifts in order to reduce the bits used to represent
        a certain image channel is that is also provides a better generalization. Consider the
        following example (see \ref EX)

        \section EX Example for the Algorithm
        <b>Segmentation format: YUV, Shifts = (8,0,0).</b> \n
        In this case, the Y (brightness) information is not used for segmentation at all. Therefore
        the pixel classification does not depend on the pixels brightness, which is very useful for
        color-segmentation. The size of the used lookup table becomes 256*256 which is 65KB.
        As the noise level of common cameras is still quite high, it might also be possible to use
        only the 7 (or even only the 6) most significant bits for the two color channels U and V
        without a significant reduction of the segmentation quality.

        \section LUT How to Define the Segmentation Lookup Table
        Another important question that has not been answered yet is, the lookup table can
        be set in order to achieve a certain segmentation result.
        Consider you want to segment a yellow ball in front of a black background. Now, you simply
        have to set the lookup table values for all possible colors of this ball to a value
        that is different from 0 (so maybe 200). Then the segmentation result will be white where
        the ball was, and black (value 0) otherwise. But how can you set up the lookup table values?
        Of course, it might be quite hard to find all possible colors of the ball, but it might
        be easy to pick some of its color e.g. by mouse. If you once have these <em>color prototype
        pixels</em>, you can now use one of the the ColorSegmentationOp::lutEntry functions
        in order to set up all corresponding lookup table entries to your class label (which was
        200 in the example above). The lutEntry methods also provide the functionality to not only
        set up the prototype-pixel's class-labels, but also the class-lables of all pixels within
        the vicinity of the prototype pixels. So sometimes, if your 'to-be-segmented'-yellow ball
        is quite homogeneously yellow, it can be sufficient to add only a single average yellow
        prototype pixel with high radii for the single color components.\n
        If you don't want to implement mouse handling in order to be able to click at your
        objects to get color-prototypes, you can also use the ICL-example tool 'icl-color-picker'.

        \section SEVERAL Using more than one Class

        By adding color prototypes for different objects, but with different class labels,
        you can also use this class to segment several objects at once. In the next step,
        you will possibly use an instance of ICLCV/RegionDetector to extract the segemented
        image regions. Here, you can then obtain the corresponding class label by using the
        ImageRegion's getVal method.
        Please note that always the last lut-entry is used if your prototype-entries overlap.

        \section REST Restrictions
        Maybe it is now, if not before
        necessary to mention, that the ColorSegmentationOp can only be set up to classify pixels
        into 255 valid classes. But actually, this should not become a problem at all as the
        classification quality usually restricts the number of classes to a maximum of about 10.
