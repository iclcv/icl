    /** \section GEN General Information about Gabor Filters

        A short introduction to Gabor filters can be found at Wikipedia:
        A Gabor filter is a linear filter whose impulse response is defined by a
        harmonic function multiplied by a Gaussian function. Because of the
        multiplication-convolution property, the Fourier transform of a Gabor
        filter's impulse response is the convolution of the Fourier transform of
        the harmonic function and the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function.
        \f[
        g(x,y;\lambda,\theta,\psi,\sigma,\gamma)=\exp(-\frac{x'^2+\gamma^2y'^2}{2\sigma^2})\cos(2\pi\frac{x'}{\lambda}+\psi)
        \f]
        where \f[ x' = x \cos\theta + y \sin\theta\,  \f]
        and \f[ y' = -x \sin\theta + y \cos\theta\, \f]

        In this equation, \f$\lambda\f$ represents the wavelength of the cosine factor, \f$\theta\f$ represents the orientation
        of the normal to the parallel stripes of a Gabor function in degrees, \f$\psi\f$ is the phase offset in degrees,
        and \f$\gamma\f$ is the spatial aspect ratio, and specifies the ellipticity of the support of the Gabor function.

        Gabor filters are directly related to Gabor wavelets, since they can be designed for number of dilations and rotations.
        However, in general, expansion is not applied for Gabor wavelets, since this requires computation of biorthogonal
        wavelets, which may be very time-consuming. Therefore, usually, a filter bank consisting of Gabor filters with various
        scales and rotations is created. The filters are convolved with the signal, resulting in a so-called Gabor space.
        This process is closely related to processes in the primary visual cortex. The Gabor space is very useful in e.g.,
        image processing applications such as iris recognition. Relations between activations for a specific spatial
        location are very distinctive between objects in an image. Furthermore, important activations can be extracted
        from the Gabor space in order to create a sparse object representation (cite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter).

        \section THECLASS The GaborOp class

        The GaborOp class provides basic functionalities for applying Gabor
        filters on Images. To achieve optimal performance, it wraps the
        ConvolutionOp class to realize the internal image convolution
        operations. Determined by a set op input parameters, it internally
        creates a filter bank that caches all gabor masks. In contrast to
        other filters, it knows two modes:
        -# <b>whole image mode</b> in this mode, the filter bank image applied on the
              whole input image, and an output image is created with one channel for
              each filter. This mode works essentially like all other UnaryOps.
        -# <b>specified center mode</b> here, the filters are applied not on all image
              locations, but on some well defined image locations. The result is
              not an image, but a matrix of filter responses, where the matrix's
              x index references the convolution center, and the y index then
              defines the filter index on this location. (... some more detail here!)



        The GaborOp class provides functionalities for the creation of Gabor-Filter kernels,
        as well as for applying gabor filter operation on images. As mentioned above, in contrast
        to other convolution operations, Gabor filters are often applied as so called
        <em>Gabor-Jets</em> at some specified image locations only. A Gabor-Jet complies
        a stack of gabor kernels that are created by some methodical variation of one,
        some or all gabor mask parameters.\n
        Each GaborOp object provide function to create a gabor jet internally, whereas
        in the easiest case, there is only one value for each parameter, an consequently,
        only a single gabor mask is created.\n
        In addition to the parameters mentioned in the formula above, the size of the
        created gabor kernels must be set, and the parameter values must be adapted to
        to it. In the following, each parameter is explained again, but this time with
        respect to its underlying effect for a kernel size of KWxKH.

        - \f$\lambda\f$ wave length of pixels (e.g. if set to KW, the wave will oscillate
          exactly once for direction (\f$\theta=0\f$)
        - \f$\theta\f$ orientation of the wave (0-> wave direction is 3 o'clock,
          \f$\frac{\pi}{2}\f$ -> wave direction is 12 o'clock)
        - \f$\psi\f$ phase shift of the wave
        - \f$\sigma\f$ std.deviation of the Gaussian multiplied with the wave
          (in pixels)
        - \f$\gamma\f$ aspect-ratio of the Gaussian
