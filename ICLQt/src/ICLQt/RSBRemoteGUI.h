    /// Creates an RSB-interface to externally get and set parameters of the wrapped GUI
    /** For each GUI-component that has a given 'handle', the
        RSBRemoteGUI will create an RSB-informer that informs if the
        component's content changes or was pressed and an RSB-listener
        that can be used to externally set the component state.
        As informer scopes, the given base-scope is used and the component's handle is
        appended as sub-scope. E.g. if the base-scope is /foo/bar, and the following GUI
        layout is used (@see qt::DynamicGUI):
        <pre>
        <vbox>
          <image handle="vis" label="Current image"/>
          <hbox>
             <slider args="0,255,128" handle="threshold" label="The Threshold"/>
             <button args="Click Me" handle="the button"/>
          </hbox>
        </vbox>
        </pre>
        , the following RSB-informers are created
        * /foo/bar/vis Which sends stringified mouse-events that occur on the image component
        * /foo/bar/threshold Which sends slider valus as strings
        * /foo/bar/the_button Which sends a "1" string when the button was pressed

        Please note, that spaces in the handle-names are internally
        translated to underscore characters as RSB-scopes do not
        support spaces. All informers uses std::strings as type.

        In addition to the informers, each component is also endowed with an RSB-listener:
        * /foo/bar/set/vis Allows for setting the visualized image (*this is a more complex listener)
        * /foo/bar/set/threshold Allows for setting the current threshold slider value
        * /foo/bar/set/the_button Allows for externally 'clicking' the button

        Please note, that for externally setting values of the
        RemoteGUI, the "/set/" subscope is inserted. A special
        treatment was needed for image, draw and draw3D componenents,
        as setting images using a stringified transport syntax would
        be very inefficient. Instead, for each component of that type,
        a standard io::RSBGrabber instance is instantiated and
        internally automatically synchronized with the corresponding
        GUI component, so that other applications can simply send
        images using an io::RSBImageOutput (we strongly recommend to
        use the io::GenericImageSender instead) allows for setting
