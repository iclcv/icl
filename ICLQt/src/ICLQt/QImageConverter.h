    /// class for conversion between QImage and core::ImgBase/Img\<T\> \ingroup COMMON
    /** The QImageConverter class provides functionality for conversion
        between the QImage class and the core::Img\<T\> classes.
        It provides an internal buffer handling for the destination images,
        so that the user does not have to care about memory handling. The
        user must only take care, that the given image is persistent.

        <h2>Use cases</h2>
        The basic use case is just to convert one Image into another:
        <pre>
        core::ImgBase *i = imgNew(...);
        QImage *q = QImageConverter(i).getImage();
        </pre>
        This will temporarily create a converter object on the stack,
        that converts the given image <em>i</em> into a qimage.
        The opposite direction (QImage to core::ImgBase) behaves identically.
        <b>Note:</b> that the converted image is only persistent as long
        as the QImageConverter object is.

        Another use-case is to optimize performance in a working loop,
        by reusing the same instance of QImageConverter. By writing
        <pre>
        QImageConverter c;
        while(true){
           ...
           core::ImgBase *i = ...
           c.setImage(i);
           QImage *q = q.getQImage();
           ...
        }
        </pre>
        The converter will internally adapt itself to this use-case
        (getting pointers to core::ImgBase objects and returning pointers to
        QImages) that no memory allocation must be performed during the
        iteration. Only if several use cases are performed alternating, it
        might be necessary to allocate and release memory during lifetime.

        <b>Note:</b> If you call setImage(core::Img8u* xxx) before calling
        getImage8u() you will get a <em> copy of the pointer xxx</em>. This
        is essentially, as you will not have a 2nd instance of the image.
