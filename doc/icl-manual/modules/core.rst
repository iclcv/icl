The Core modules provides basic types, classes and functions for image
processing. In particular it introduces ICL's image classes
:icl:`ImgBase` and the derived templates :icl:`Img`, where its
template parameter *T* defines the pixel data type.

The Image Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| For the implementation of the image classes, we combined inheritance    | .. image:: images/image-sketch.png |
| and class-templates: The :icl:`ImgBase` class defines an abstract       |      :alt: shadow                  |
| interface, that manages all image information except for the actual     |                                    |
| image pixel data. It works as generic interface for                     |                                    |

.. _core.image.types:

Supported Image Types
"""""""""""""""""""""

The :icl:`Img` template class is **not** implemented in a completely
**inline** fashion, which significantly improves the build-times for
ICL and for other libraries, that depend on it. Furthermore, we
preferred to provide a smaller set of possible image classes that is
completely supported by our algorithms, rather than an infinite
set. We chose to support images for pixel types

* :icl:`icl8u` (usually **unsigned char**)
* :icl:`icl16s` (usually **short**)
* :icl:`icl32s` (usually **int**)
* :icl:`icl32f` (**float**)
* :icl:`icl64f` (**double**)

defined in **ICLUtils/BasicTypes.h**, directly in the
:icl:`icl`-namespace (see also :ref:`utils.basic-types`)


Each of these data types has it's own advantages and
disadvantages. The greatest disadvantage of the integer types, is
their bounded range (e.g. 0-255 for icl8u), which has the effect, that
all information has to be scaled to this range. Furthermore, all image
processing functions must take care that no range-overflow occurs
during calculation. The limited range may also cause loss of
information -- particularly in complex systems. However integer types
can often be processed significantly faster, and the use of 8 or 16
bit integers leads to less memory usage in comparison to floats

.. note::

 A nice rule of thumb is: If processing speed matters, use **icl8u**
 pixels whenever it's possible and avoid Img64f because double
 processing is much slower on (still common) 32 bit machines (as long
 as you do not really need double precision)


For the supported types convenience **typedef**\ s are
supported. Whenever one gets an :icl:`ImgBase` instance, it's
:icl:`ImgBase::getDepth`-method can be used to query it's actual
run-time type in oder to perform a type-safe down-cast. The
:icl:`core::depth` enumeration provides alternatives for each of the
supported image types.

=====================  ===================  ======================
      Full Type              typedef            **depth**-value
=====================  ===================  ======================
**core::Img<icl8u>**   :icl:`core::Img8u`    :icl:`core::depth8u`
**core::Img<icl16s>**  :icl:`core::Img16s`   :icl:`core::depth16s`
**core::Img<icl32s>**  :icl:`core::Img32s`   :icl:`core::depth32s`
**core::Img<icl32f>**  :icl:`core::Img32f`   :icl:`core::depth32f`
**core::Img<icl64f>**  :icl:`core::Img64f`   :icl:`core::depth64f`
=====================  ===================  ======================

Here is a minimal example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/imgbase.cpp
  :language: c++
  :linenos:


.. _core.image.pixel-access:

Pixel Access
""""""""""""

The :icl:`ImgBase` class provides only raw-data access (in shape of a
**void***); for type-safe pixel access, an :icl:`ImgBase`-instance
must be casted into it's actual :icl:`Img`-type. The different
techniques for pixel-access are also discussed in the
:ref:`tutorial<tut.pixel-access>`

.. _core.image.shallow-copy:

Shallow Copy Concept
""""""""""""""""""""

It is very important to know that :icl:`ImgBase` and
:icl:`Img`-instances are copied shallowly. This means that, whenever
an image is copied using either a the copy constructor or the
assignment operator, the two images will share their image data
pointers:

.. literalinclude:: examples/shallow-copy.cpp
  :language: c++
  :linenos:


.. _core.image.data-origin:

Data Origin
"""""""""""

Just like most of the common image formats, we also defined the upper
left image corner as data origin. Actually, many image operations,
such as filtering or thresholding, do not even use this information at
all. However, as soon as it comes to image visualization and
annotation, the definition of the origin is crucial.

.. _core.image.channel-concept:

Channel-Concept
"""""""""""""""

The :icl:`Img` class manages images as a stack of image slices --
channels. Channels can be shared by multiple :icl:`Img` instances,
which is especially important for fast shallow images copies (see also
:ref:`core.image.shallow-copy`). Actually, it is possible to freely
compose images from channels of different images. The composed image
then shares it's channel data with the original images, such that
modifications will effect all images equally. In order to get an
independent image a *deep-copy* as well as the
:icl:`ImgBase::detach`-method are provided. The latter replaces the
*shared* image channel(s) with new independent ones. Shared channel
data are stored using the boost-like shared pointer class
:icl:`utils::SmartArray`, which uses reference counting for
autonomous garbage collection.

.. _core.image.roi:


Regions of Interest (ROI)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each image can be set up with a rectangular region of interest (short
**ROI**). Most support this feature, i.e. they process only the pixels
within the ROI. If a function does not support ROI handling, it's
documentation will announce this.  Providing ROI support for custom
algorithms, can be achieved in different ways. In general, we
distinguish between *native* and *non-native* ROI support.  If
algorithms extract an images ROI before the actual processing takes
place, we name this *non-native* support. Usually, this is slightly
slower, then actually implementing an algorithms, that works directly
on an image ROI. However, there are several pixel accessing techniques
that provide implicit ROI handling (see
:ref:`tutorial<tut.pixel-access>`).


.. _core.image.format:

Formats and Ranges
""""""""""""""""""

An :icl:`ImgBase` instance provides information about the (color) format
(in shape of an :icl:`core::format` value), that is associated with
the image data represented by the images channels. The word *color*
was embraced as not all available formats imply color-information. The
most commonly known color space is probably the RGB color space. If an
:icl:`ImgBase` image has the :icl:`core::format` :icl:`core::formatRGB`

* the image has exactly 3 channels
* the first channel contains RED-Data in range [0,255]
* the second channel contains GREEN-Data in range [0,255]
* the third channel contains BLUE-Data in range [0,255]

.. note::

   The range of all possible color format components is always
   assumed to be in range [0,255].

As soon as the channel count of the image is altered, it's format will
automatically be set to :icl:`core::formatMatrix`, which is used for
unspecified color formats.


.. _core.image.convert:

Deep Copies and Depth Conversion
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Deep Copies

  Images cannot only be copied shallowly, but also in a *deep copy*
  manner. In particular, if the source- and destination-image's depth
  is not identical, the data types have to be converted *deeply*
  (i.e. pixel by pixel). Even though, the :icl:`Img::detached` method
  can be used for copying an image *deeply*, we strongly recommend to
  use image's :icl:`ImgBase::deepCopy` methods, since in contrast to
  the :icl:`Img::detached` no temporary object needs to be created
  here. Actually there are two different versions of **deepCopy**:

  * **ImgBase::deepCopy(ImgBase **dst)** (see :icl:`ImgBase::deepCopy`)
  * **Img<T>::deepCopy(Img<T> *dst)** (see :icl:`Img::deepCopy`)

  The **ImgBase**-method uses a pointer-pointer to be able to adapt
  the destination images **depth** if necessary (see also
  :ref:`core::ensureCompatible<core.global.image.ensureCompatible>`,
  :ref:`core::bpp<core.global.image.bpp>` and
  :ref:`tut.imgbase-ptrptrs`). For the :icl:`Img`-version, the
  destination image depth is restricted to the source depth by the
  function interface, which is why a *normal* pointer-interface is
  sufficient here. Both deep copy functions will always ensure,
  that the source and the destination image are equal in all it's
  parameters.

  .. note::

     There are dedicated methods :icl:`ImgBase::deepCopyROI` that
     provide ROI support for deeply copying images. These will always
     use both, the source and the destination image ROI.



Depth Conversion

  Converting an images :icl:`depth` is even simpler to understand than
  the deep-copy procedure, because there is just one version of
  :icl:`core::ImgBase::convert`. This method, will keep the destination
  image's format, but adapt all other image parameters, such as size
  channel count and color format to the source image before converting
  the image pixels element-wise


.. _core.image.const:

Const-Concept
"""""""""""""

ICL images use the const concept of C++ to ensure the pixel data of
const images (of type **const** :icl:`ImgBase` or more precisely
**const** :icl:`Img` can not be altered/can only be accessed for
reading. Unfortunately this leads to a conflict with our
*shallow-copy* concept in the example::

  void func(const Img8u &a){
    Img8u b = a;
    b.clear();
  }

The originally **const** image **a** is shallowly copied to **b**, and
clearing **b** does also clear **a**. Even though this could lead to
really unexpected results, we decided to stick to this behavior since
a fix would either entail to disable the *shallow copy on default*
property, or deeply- and shallowly copied images would have to be
represented by wrapper-classes, which would make the whole library
much more difficult to understand.



.. _core.types:

Image Processing related Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:icl:`core::depth`

  Run-time type for different image pixel types (see :ref:`core.image.types`)

:icl:`core::format`

  Color format type (see :ref:`core.color`)

:icl:`core::scalemode`

  Scaling and sampling interpolation mode. Supported values
  are

  * :icl:`core::interpolateNN` for nearest neighbor interpolation
  * :icl:`core::interpolateLIN` for linear interpolation
  * :icl:`core::interpolateRA` for region average interpolation, which
    provides much better results in case of downscaling images (Only
    supported with Intel IPP)

  .. todo::

    consider implementing super-sampling (RA) for or even lanczos for scaled copy roi
    Note: we are already working on this

:icl:`core::axis`

  Either :icl:`core::axisHorz`, :icl:`core::axisVert` or
  :icl:`core::axisBoth`. This defines image axes for mirroring and
  other operations.


**Line Sampling**

  For efficient line sampling into an image grid using the *Bresenham* algorithm,
  the :icl:`LineSampler` class is provided. The simpler-to-use utility classes
  :icl:`core::Line`, :icl:`core::Line32f` use the LineSampler, but provide
  a slighly worse run-time due to memory allocation overhead.

**Color Typedefs**

  Even though not used for color conversion, the ICLCore package
  provides some default type-names for different color types. All of
  these typedefs have special :icl:`math::FixedMatrix` as origin

  * :icl:`core::Color`
  * :icl:`core::Color4D`
  * :icl:`core::Color32f`
  * :icl:`core::Color4D32f`
  * :icl:`core::RGB`
  * :icl:`core::RGBA`

.. _core.global-functions:

Global Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The core package provides a set of global support functions, that can
be split into functions for

* :ref:`core.color`
* :ref:`core.global.image`
* :ref:`core.global.opencv`
* :ref:`core.global.statistic`
* :ref:`core.global.convex-hull`

.. _core.global.image:

Image Class Support Functions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:icl:`core::interleavedToPlanar`

  Can be use to efficiently transform externally acquire interleaved pixel data
  into an ICL image. This function works very fast, in particular in case of
  having Intel IPP support.

:icl:`core::planarToInterleaved`

  Just the other way around: this function can be used to transform the planar
  ICL image data into an externally needed interleaved data layout

:icl:`core::imgNew`

  This function is provided in many different versions. It can be used as
  factory functions for creating correct :icl:`core::Img`-instances from given
  :icl:`core::depth` values

.. _core.global.image.ensureCompatible:

:icl:`core::ensureCompatible`

  This set of functions are even more complex then the :icl:`imgNew`
  function. A specific issue of ICL image class structure is, that we
  use an *is-a* relation between the interface class
  :icl:`core::ImgBase` and the actual image instances
  :icl:`core::Img`. Whenever we face a situation, where we already
  have an existing :icl:`ImgBase`-instance (that obviously has a fixed
  :icl:`core::depth`), but we need an :icl:`ImgBase` instance of a
  different depth, we have to do the following. Our only options is to
  allocate a new :icl:`Img` where T is the desired type, and to
  replace the old instance with the new one (e.g. the old-one has to
  be deleted). In order to tell the caller-scope that an image was
  actually re-allocated, functions need to provide an
  :icl:`ImgBase`\ ******-interaface. This is also discussed more in detail
  in the tutorial chapter :ref:`tut.imgbase-ptrptrs`.

.. _core.global.image.bpp:

:icl:`core::bpp`

  This global function is strongly correlated to the :icl:`ImgBase`\
  ******-issue stated with the explanation of
  :icl:`core::ensureCompatible`. Many ICL operators, in particular all
  filters in the **ICLFilter** package, provide an :icl:`ImgBase`\
  ******-interface to allow filters to even adapt the
  :icl:`core::depth` of given destination images. In a few situation,
  we know however the correct depth however in advance. Here, the
  :icl:`bpp`-function (which is abbreviation for
  :icl:`ImgBase`-pointer-pointer can be used, to avoid having to
  allocate a temporary object

  .. literalinclude:: examples/imgbase-ptrptr.cpp
    :language: c++
    :linenos:


.. _core.global.convex-hull:

2D Convex Hull Functions
""""""""""""""""""""""""
The header file :icl:`ConvexHull.h` provides two easy to use functions
:icl:`core::convexHull` that compute the convex hull of a given set of
either :icl:`Point32f` or :icl:`Point` instances

.. _core.global.opencv:

OpenCV Image Conversion Functions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ICLCore module also provides a set of compatibility functions for
converting ICL images into OpenCV's **cv::Mat** type and vice versa.

* :icl:`core::ipl_to_img`
* :icl:`core::img_to_ipl`
* :icl:`core::img_to_cvmat`
* :icl:`core::img_to_ipl_shallow` (for shallow copies)
* :icl:`core::img_to_cvmat_shallow` (for shallow copies)







.. _core.global.statistic:

Image Statistic Functions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

:icl:`core::hist` and :icl:`core::channelHisto`

  creates an image histogram with a user defined number of bins for a
  single or all channels of an image. Please note that ICL's default
  image displaying GUI component is also able to show the histogram of
  the currently shown image

:icl:`core::mean`

  computes the mean value for one or all given channels of an image

:icl:`core::variance`

  computes the variance for one or all given channels of an image

:icl:`core::stdDeviation`

  computes the standard deviation for one or all given channels of an
  image. Here, two versions, one with given mean-values and one that
  uses an empiric mean are provided.

:icl:`core::meanAndStdDev`

  computes mean and standard deviation at once



.. _core.color:



Color Formats and Color Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Table of Contents

* :ref:`core.color.matrix`
* :ref:`core.color.benchmark`

By now, ICL supports 7 different color formats. For each of these
formats, an :icl:`core::format` value is provided.

=============================  =====================================
   :icl:`core::format`                      meaning
=============================  =====================================
  :icl:`core::formatRGB`          sRGB color format
  :icl:`core::formatHLS`          Hue Lightness Intensity
  :icl:`core::formatYUV`          Luminance Y and Chrominance U/V
  :icl:`core::formatChroma`       R/G-Chromaticity space
  :icl:`core::formatLAB`          CIE-L\*a\*b\* space
  :icl:`core::formatGray`         simple gray scale
  :icl:`core::formatMatrix`       unspecified color format
=============================  =====================================


The main function for color format conversion is :icl:`core::cc`.
:icl:`core::cc` uses the source and the destination :icl:`format` to pick
the desired format conversion function internally.  If the
**roiOnly**-flag given to :icl:`core::cc` function is set to true, the source
image's ROI is converted into the destination image's ROI. In this
case, the destination image is not adapted to the source
image. Instead, a single test is performed to ensure, that the source
image's ROI has the same size as the destination image's ROI. If the
test fails, an error occurs and the function returns immediately.

.. note::

   Internally all functions are optimized for running without ROI
   support (in this case, the images data arrays are 1D). Thus, the
   ROI-Support mode (roiOnly = true) runs approx. 20% (2%-50%) slower
   depended on the specific source and destination format.

The :icl:`core::cc` function uses Intel IPP to speed up the conversion
performance for the conversions

* YUV -> RGB
* RGB -> HLS
* HLS -> RGB

.. _core.color.lut:

Creating LUT-Acceleration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

All color conversion methods can be statically performed using a
global lookup table for the color conversion. This is done by calling
:icl:`core::createLUT` with the to-be-accelerated source and destination
format. **We do not recommend to use this features because it usually makes
the color conversion significantly slower**


.. _core.color.ranges:

Color Ranges
""""""""""""

As a default, all ICL color spaces are represented in the full range
of [0,255] in all depths. By these means, we get the advantage of being able
to treat all color images in the same way. The disadvantage is, that
already existing color conversion routines needed to be adapted to scale
each color component to that range automatically.


.. _core.color.video-formats:

Special Video Coding Color Formats
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In video coding, usually certain YUV sub-formats are used, that use
different horizontal and vertical resolutions for the Y and the U/V
channels. Even though these format provide an objectively loss-less
reduction of the image data size, they are, due to the more complex
data layout, not appropriate for digital image processing.  For a very
few of these YUV sub-formats, ICL provides efficient conversion
routines, however these must usually not be used manually because the
image acquisition framework provides implicitly converted ICL-images
directly. A more general tool for video-color format conversion is
provided by the :icl:`io::ColorFormatDecoder` (see
:ref:`io.color-format-decoder`)


.. _core.color.rgb:

sRGB (Most Common and Default)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Obviously, the RGB Color Model (or its absolute Version sRGB ->
standard RGB) is the most commonly known color space. Even though many
computer vision approaches use other color spaces, such as HLS or LAB,
the sRGB color space defines a an *anchor* for most other color
conversion functions. So in most cases, the sRGB format defines a bridge
format for conversion from one to another format:

* X -> Y
* X -> RGB
* RGB -> Y

Another bridge color space (XYZ) is not considered here, because it
usually not used in digital image processing. For ICL's color conversion
functions we can say:

* Converting from or to RGB is fast
* other conversion may be much slower.
* In particular the L*a*b* space is supported only very slowly


.. _core.color.yuv:

YUV Space Color Conversion
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The literature for the YUV color model conversion is a bit confusing
and far away from a kind of pseudocode, that can easily be converted
to *fast* C++ code. The YUV Color model divides an incoming RGB signal
into its luminance component (Y) and two chrominance components (U and
V). The common YUV-color holds Y in the range [0,1], u in range
[-0.436,0.436] and v in range [-0.615,0,615]. Hence ICL's color
conversion functions are adapted to scale the resulting values to the
range [0,255] in all channels. Outgoing from the basic equation for
converting rgb to yuv and back::

        Y = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B
        U = -0.147*R - 0.289*G + 0.436*B = 0.492*(B- Y)
        V = 0.615*R - 0.515*G - 0.100*B = 0.877*(R- Y)
        R = Y + 1.140*V
        G = Y - 0.394*U - 0.581*V
        B = Y + 2.032*U

The formulas are adapted for using ranges [0,255]::

        Y = (0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B);
        U = 0.56433408*(B-Y) + 127.5;
        V = 0.71326676*(R-Y) + 127.5;
        R = Y +               290.7   * v2;
        G = Y - 100.47 * u2 - 148.155 * v2;   with: u2 = 0.0034196078*U - 0.436;
        B = Y + 518.16 * u2;                   and  v2 = 0.0048235294*V - 0.615;

To avoid expensive floating point operations, the conversions can be
optimized by creating a so called fixed point approximation of the
above code::

        Y = ( 1254097*R + 2462056*G + 478151*B ) >> 22;
        U = ( 2366989*(B-Y) + 534773760        ) >> 22;
        V = ( 2991658*(R-Y) + 534773760        ) >> 22;
        R = Y +  ( ( 290 * V2 ) >> 22 );
        G = Y -  ( ( 100  * U2 + 148 * V2) >> 22 ); with: U2 = 14343*U - 1828717;
        B = Y +  ( ( 518 * U2 ) >> 22 );             and  V2 = 20231*v - 2579497;

This approximation produces errors less 3/255, and runs up to 20%
faster. A further optimization can be implemented using lookup tables.


IPP Compatibility

  In order to achieve compatibility with the yuv color conversion
  provided by intel IPP (which is used if IPP is available), also
  ICL's color conversion methods were slightly adapted. We again used
  fixed point approximations for the algorithms described in the IPP
  manual::

        rgb-to-yuv:
        y = ( 1254097*r + 2462056*g + 478151*b ) >> 22;
        u = (2063598*(b-y) >> 22) + 128;
        v = (3678405*(r-y) >> 22) + 128;
        if(v<0) v=0;
        else if(v > 255) v = 255;

        yuv-to-rgb:
        icl32s u2 = u-128;
        icl32s v2 = v-128;
        icl32s y2 = y<<22;
        r = (y2 + 4781506 * v2 ) >> 22;
        g = (y2 - 1652556 * u2 - 2436891 *v2 ) >> 22;
        b = (y2 + 8522826 * u2 ) >> 22;

  .. note::

     Due to the clipping process of 'v' in **rgb_to_yuv**, this method
     cannot restore an original rgb value completetly. Since we lost
     some information in v, the resulting r and g values are differ as
     follows: r-r' in [-32,35], and g-g' in [-17,18], However, this is
     usually only an issue when exchanging image between ICL
     applications that used Intel IPP and others that did not.


.. _core.color.hls:

HLS Color Space Conversion
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The HLS color space, also known as the HSI color space with different
channel order describes colors in more independent components. The Hue
component can be understood as an angle and is as well as all other color
information scaled to the range [0,254]. The value H=255 is identical
to H=0 (red). Independent from the color's *hue*, it's *lightness* is
defined by the second component. Basic colors as red (r=255,g=0,b=0)
have a lightness of 127; lighter colors have a higher L value; darker
colors have a lower one. The last component is the *saturation* of the
color. The color model can be drawn as a double (hex)cone . Note that
the HLS color spaces resolution is higher in it's center (L near
127). The following formulas describe the conversion from and to the
RGB format::

        (H,L,S) RGBToHLS(R,G,B)
        (r,g,b) = (R,G,B)/255;
        m = min(r,g,b)
        v = max(r,g,b)
        l = (m+v)/2
        if(l <= 0){
          (H,L,S) = (0,0,0)
          return
        }
        vm = v-m
        if ( vm > 0 ) {
          if(l<=0.5){
            s=vm/(v+m)
          }else{
            s=vm/(2.0-v-m)
          }
        }else{
          (H,L,S)=(0,l*255,0)
          return
        }
        r2 = (v - r) / vm
        g2 = (v - g) / vm
        b2 = (v - b) / vm
        if (r == v)
          h = (g == m ? 5.0 + b2 : 1.0 - g2)
        else if (g == v)
          h = (b == m ? 1.0 + r2 : 3.0 - b2)
        else
          h = (r == m ? 3.0 + g2 : 5.0 - r2)
        if(h == 255) h = 0
          (H,L,S) = (h*255/6,l*255,s*255)

An optimization, that allows conversion directly with (r,g,b) values
in range [0,255] is not yet implemented::

        (R,G,B) HLSToRGB(H,L,S)
        (h,l,s) = (H,L,S)/255;
        v = (l <= 0.5) ? (l * (1.0 + sl)) : (l + sl - l * sl)
        if (v <= 0 ) {
          R = G = B = 0;
          return;
        }
        m = l + l - v;
        sv = (v - m ) / v;
        h *= 6.0;
        int sextant = (int)h;
        fract = h - sextant;
        vsf = v * sv * fract;
        mid1 = m + vsf;
        mid2 = v - vsf;
        switch (sextant) {
          case 0: r = v;    g = mid1; b = m;    break;
          case 1: r = mid2; g = v;    b = m;    break;
          case 2: r = m;    g = v;    b = mid1; break;
          case 3: r = m;    g = mid2; b = v;    break;
          case 4: r = mid1; g = m;    b = v;    break;
          case 5: r = v;    g = m;    b = mid2; break;
        }
        (R,G,B) = (r,g,b)*255;

An additional optimization can be implemented using lookup tables


.. _core.color.lab:

Lab Color Space Conversion
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The LAB color space (strictly CIE L*a*b*), was designed to describe
the complete range of colors, that can be seen by the human eye. It
must not be mixed up with the "Hunter Lab" color space, that is sure
related to the CIE L*a*b*, but in detail much different: "The three
parameters in the model represent the lightness of the color (L*, L*=0
yields black and L*=100 indicates white), its position between magenta
and green (a*, negative values indicate green while positive values
indicate magenta) and its position between yellow and blue (b*,
negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate
yellow) [...] CIE 1976 L*a*b* is based directly on the CIE
1931 XYZ color space as an attempt to linearize the perceptibility of
color differences, using the color difference metric described by the
MacAdam ellipse"(wikipedia). So an euclidian (linear) color difference
metric can be used here. The following code show the formulas

Gray Scale Conversion
"""""""""""""""""""""

The gray scale conversion is optimized for speed.  Although, L of Lab
is not equal to the Y of YUV, color formats, that have an
brightness-like component are converted to gray scale by simply
picking this channel. RGB is converted to gray by the simple channel
mean (r+g+b)/3.

r-g-Chromaticity Color Space Conversion
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The chromaticity space r,g,b divides the R,G,B components by the city
block norm of the according color r=R/(R+G+B), g=G/(R+G+B), b=
B/(R+G+B). By these means, the b-component becomes redundant, and can
be left out, which leads to the r-g-chromaticity space. Conversions
from the r-g-Chromaticity space to other formats are not possible, as
r-g-pixels to not carry enough information for this.

.. _core.color.matrix:

formatMatrix Conversion
"""""""""""""""""""""""

As the matrix image format offers no color information, matrix image
data is just copied from the source image channels to the destination

channels are left unregarded. If otherwise the destination image has
more channels, this channels are left unchanged
