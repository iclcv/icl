    /// Utility class that allows to create 3D (optionally colored) point clouds from given 2D core::depth images
    /** The PointCloudCreator utility class can be used to two differenct modes.
        It's basic functionality is to transform a core::depth-image into a 3D point cloud. 
        For this, a Camera instances is needed, which can be obtained from ICL's
        camera calibration tool icl-cam-calib-2 for real core::depth cameras such as Kinect.
        
        If also a second camera file is provided for the color camera, then
        the PointCloudCreator class can also be used for mapping optionally given
        RGB-byte images to the contained point's colors.
  
        \section _SPEED_ Benchmarks
        For VGA point clouds, creation with RGBD mapping takes about 8ms on a 2.5 GHz Core2Duo machine.
        If RGBD-mapping is not performed, the simple point cloud creation is performed in about 6 ms.
        For futher speed optimizations, we plan to add openmp optimization in the future.
