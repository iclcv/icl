    /// Special Octree implemenation that supports to query points close to caste rays
    /** The RayCastOctreeObject defines all template parameters of the more general
        OctreeObject class, while preserving the super classe's interface, it adds
        the rayCast function, which can be used to query all points, that are
        close to a given view-ray.

        \section ALGO Algorithm

        Internally the octree structure is exploited for accelerating ray casts.
        Each node's AABB (axis aligned bounding box) defines a bounding sphere around
        it's center. The radius of the bounding sphere is pre-computed and accessible
        from the Node structure. Whenever the center of node is further away
        from the view-ray than the pre-computed node radius plus the maximum distance
        to the ray the node and all it's sub-nodes are not tested any further.
        As an additional speed-up, internally squared distances are used to avoid
        expensive square-root calculations.


        \section SPEED Ray Cast Run Time
        On a Core i5 @ 3.4 GHz with 8GB Ram and 64 Bit linux, an orthogonal ray cast into
        a regular grid 2D point cloud in 3D space (containing a typical number of,
        320x240 points) takes about 3.2 micro-secounds - that is 330 ray-casts per
        millisecond. This is about 250 times faster than a brute force search.
