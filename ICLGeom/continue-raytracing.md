# Raytracing — Continuation Guide

## Current State (Session 17 — Zoom Fix: UV Crop + Projection Crop Matrix)

### Session 17 Summary

**Fixed 2D image zoom (UV-based crop in GLImageRenderer):**
- Old approach used oversized `glViewport` that conflicted with GLImageRenderer's
  letterbox scaling, causing misaligned zoom, NaN artifacts, and broken AR handling.
- New: `render(cropX, cropY, cropW, cropH)` passes zoom sub-region as UV coordinates
  to `uUVOffset`/`uUVScale` shader uniforms. Renderer letterboxes based on crop AR.
- No stored crop state — crop rect passed directly to render call (eliminates race).
- `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE` on texture prevents repeated/mirrored artifacts in letterbox bars.
- NaN/bounds validation in `drawQuadWithCrop` falls back to full image if invalid.
- GL state save/restore (depth test, texture binding) prevents QPainter interference.
- `mouseReleaseEvent`: removed `fixRectAR` (no longer needed — renderer handles any AR
  via letterboxing), added [0,1] clamping and div-by-zero guard.
- `resizeEvent`: removed `fixRectAR` for zoom mode (UV zoom re-letterboxes automatically).
- `getImageRect()` for zoom: computes virtual image rect from display rect + zoom rect
  for correct mouse/pixel coordinate mapping.

**Fixed 3D scene zoom (projection crop matrix in GLRenderer):**
- Old viewport approach created SSR FBOs at N× widget size, hitting GPU texture limits
  at ~3-5× zoom (scene suddenly disappeared).
- New: crop matrix pre-multiplied onto projection matrix narrows FOV to zoomed sub-region,
  rendering at native viewport resolution regardless of zoom level.
- Crop matrix (row-major): `sx=1/zw, tx=(1-2*zx-zw)/zw, sy=1/zh, ty=(2*zy+zh-1)/zh`
- Viewport letterboxed for crop sub-region's AR, matching 2D image display.
- Previous Session 16 attempt at crop matrix failed due to wrong math — this session
  re-derived correctly accounting for ICL's row-major Mat with GL_TRUE transpose.

**Overlay viewer verified working:**
- Cycles bg + GL overlay compositing, alpha slider, camera sync, material presets, zoom
  all tested and confirmed working.

### Next Steps

- **Refactor cycles-scene-viewer.cpp** — replace inline setupScene/decimateMesh with
  `SceneSetup.h` calls (duplicate code exists in both viewer and library)
- **Red-tinted context in letterbox bars** — deferred idea: show surrounding image content
  tinted red in the letterbox areas during zoom for spatial context
- **Wheel zoom** — currently `#if 0`'d out in Widget.cpp, needs reimplementation with
  UV-based zoom approach

## Previous State (Session 16 — Crash Fix + Camera Drag Optimization)

### Session 16 Summary

**Fixed overlay viewer crash #1 (null outputDriver):**
- Root cause: `CyclesRenderer::getImage()` dereferenced `m_impl->outputDriver` which is
  null before `ensureInitialized()` runs. The management thread (started by `start()`)
  calls `ensureInitialized()` asynchronously, but `run()` calls `rt.getImage()` immediately.
- Fix: `getImage()` returns a static empty `Img8u` when `outputDriver` is null.
  Same guard added to `setOnImageReady()`.
- Stack trace showed: `pthread_mutex_lock` crash at address 0xe0 (null + mutex offset)
  in `RaytracingOutputBuffer::getImage()` called from `CyclesRenderer::getImage()`.

**Fixed overlay viewer crash #2 (DataStore UnassignableTypesException):**
- `gui["canvas"] = Image(rtImg)` threw because DataStore had no `core::Image` →
  handle conversions registered. The `FROM_IMG` macro only covers `Img8u`,
  `Img16s`, etc. and `ImgBase` — not the `Image` wrapper.
- Fix: added `Image` → `ImageHandle`, `DrawHandle`, `DrawHandle3D` conversions
  in DataStore.cpp (both assignment specializations and registrations).
  `Image` delegates to `setImage(src.ptr())` for widget handles.

**Camera drag uses invalidateTransforms() instead of invalidateAll():**
- `handleMouse()` in `cycles-overlay-viewer.cpp` now calls `invalidateTransforms()`
  on drag/release. This only sets `transformDirty` on SceneSynchronizer entries,
  skipping expensive retessellation that `invalidateAll()` would trigger via
  `geometryDirty`. Camera rotation only needs transform/camera update.

**Removed 1ms sleep between batches:**
- The sleep was unnecessary — if multiple batches complete between GUI redraws,
  the user just sees a less noisy (better) image. Faster convergence is always better.
- The GUI thread picks up whatever the latest image is via the double buffer.

**Grabber acquireImage/acquireDisplay bridge:**
- `Grabber::grabImage()` calls `grab()` → `acquireImage()`, but ALL existing grabber
  subclasses override `acquireDisplay()` (the old name). `acquireImage()` returned nullptr.
- Fix: `Grabber::acquireImage()` now falls back to `acquireDisplay()`. All grabbers work.

**DemoImage in-memory JPEG decode:**
- All 6 `DemoImage*.cpp` files (lena, parrot, mandril, flowers, cameraman, windows)
  used to write the compiled-in JPEG bytes to a temp file, then read it back via
  FileGrabber. This failed in sandboxed environments.
- Fix: decode directly from memory via `JPEGDecoder::decode(buf.data(), DIM, &image)`.
  No temp files needed. Include changed from `FileGrabber.h` to `JPEGDecoder.h`.

**Added `ICLWidget::getZoomRect()`:**
- Returns normalized zoom rect or (0,0,1,1) if not zoomed. In Widget.h/.cpp.

**GLRenderer zoom — crop matrix REVERTED:**
- Attempted projection crop matrix approach for 3D zoom (normal viewport + modified
  projection). Showed only a triangle — crop matrix math was wrong (likely ICL's
  row-major matrix convention vs the column-major assumption in the derivation).
- Reverted to viewport-based zoom (same as 2D image). Both renderers use the same
  viewport, so they stay in sync even though the zoom is wrong.
- The crop matrix approach IS the right long-term solution (avoids huge SSR FBOs,
  correct at extreme zoom). The math needs to be re-derived accounting for ICL's
  `Mat` conventions (row-major, GL_TRUE transpose in `glUniformMatrix4fv`).
- Crop matrix formula (for reference, needs verification with ICL's Mat layout):
  ```
  sx = 1/zw,  tx = (1 - 2*zx - zw) / zw
  sy = 1/zh,  ty = (2*zy + zh - 1) / zh
  ```

### Zoom Bug — Analysis and Status (UNRESOLVED)

**The core problem:** `computeRect(fmZoom)` produces a viewport rect that interacts
with `GLImageRenderer::drawQuad()`'s internal letterbox scaling. When the viewport AR
doesn't match the image AR, GLImageRenderer shifts the image within the viewport,
breaking the zoom alignment.

**How zoom currently works (viewport approach):**
1. User drags rect on image → `mouseReleaseEvent` normalizes to image coords → `fixRectAR`
   adjusts width/height so `vpAR = imageAR` at the current widget size
2. `computeRect(fmZoom)` produces viewport: `vpW=widgetW/zoomW, vpH=widgetH/zoomH`
3. `glViewport(vpX, vpY, vpW, vpH)` with GL Y-flip: `vpY = (-dy - r.y) * dpr`
4. `GLImageRenderer::drawQuad()` reads viewport, computes letterbox `uScale`, renders

**Where it breaks:**
- **Non-square images:** For a 750×1002 (portrait) image in a 320×240 (landscape) widget,
  `fixRectAR` sets `zoomW/zoomH = widgetAR/imageAR = 1.780`. This makes
  `vpAR = widgetAR * zoomH/zoomW = ... = imageAR`. So no letterboxing — should work.
  BUT: empirically the zoom is still wrong for the parrot. Need to investigate whether
  `fixRectAR` itself, the mouseReleaseEvent normalization, or the GL Y-flip is at fault.
- **Widget resize while zoomed:** `fixRectAR` was applied once at zoom-selection time
  for a specific widget AR. When the widget is resized, the zoomRect's AR no longer
  matches. Attempted fix: re-apply AR adjustment in `computeRect` (preserving center
  and area) — still produces wrong results. Left in code for now, may need removal.
- **Excessive zoom:** viewport values reach 8760×11704 pixels (for ~14× zoom). Not a
  GPU limit issue (viewport is just a clipping region), but wasteful for 3D rendering
  where SSR FBO is sized to viewport.

**Debug output in place:** Widget.cpp paintGL prints `[Zoom]` lines every 60 frames
with zoomRect, computeRect result, and glViewport values. Remove when fixed.

**Key files for zoom investigation:**
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp:863` — `computeRect()` function (fmZoom case ~line 895)
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp:915` — `fixRectAR()` function
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp:2267` — `mouseReleaseEvent` zoom rect normalization
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp:2414` — wheel zoom handling
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp:1994` — Core Profile paintGL zoom viewport
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/GLImageRenderer.cpp:270` — `drawQuad()` with letterbox scaling
- `ICLGeom/src/ICLGeom/GLRenderer.cpp:1096` — GLRenderer widget-aware zoom viewport

**Possible fix approaches (not yet tried):**
1. **UV-based zoom in GLImageRenderer:** Add `uUVOffset`/`uUVScale` uniforms to the
   quad shader. Instead of viewport tricks, set the viewport to the base letterboxed
   rect and adjust UVs to show the zoom sub-region. Cleanest separation of concerns.
   GLImageRenderer would need `setCropRect(Rect32f)`. The letterbox scaling must then
   use the sub-region AR, not the full image AR.
2. **Disable GLImageRenderer letterbox in zoom mode:** Set `scaleX=scaleY=1.0` when
   zoomed, since `computeRect` already accounts for AR. Risk: breaks if computeRect
   doesn't perfectly match the image AR.
3. **Build a minimal test case:** Write a simple test app that shows a known image with
   known zoom rect and prints all coordinates. Verify each step of the pipeline.

### Next Steps

## Previous State (Session 15 — Autonomous CyclesRenderer + Progressive Display)

### Session 15 Summary

**CyclesRenderer autonomous mode fully reworked:**

The `start(camIndex)` API now provides proper autonomous progressive rendering.
A background management thread drives the render loop; the application just calls
`getImage()` to display the latest intermediate result.

**Architecture (autonomous mode):**
- `start(0)` launches a management thread running `managementLoop()`
- Outer loop: waits on CV for `dirty` signal → syncs scene → `session->reset()` +
  `session->start()` with `samplesPerStep` samples
- Inner loop: waits on CV for `batchReady` (signaled by `write_render_tile` callback)
  → checks dirty after each batch → if dirty, breaks and restarts; if not, extends
  samples until converged
- Dirty is only checked AFTER each batch completes, so every batch produces a visible
  intermediate image (noisy → progressively refined)
- Setters (setMaxBounces, setExposure, etc.) have equality guards — no-op if value
  unchanged. When value changes, `markDirty()` sets dirty flag + notifies CV.
- `invalidateAll()` / `invalidateTransforms()` also call `markDirty()`
- No `session->cancel()` from main thread. `session->reset()` handles cancellation
  internally (waits for current batch to finish, which is fast at 1 sample/step)
- 1ms sleep between batches ensures Qt's paint cycle can display intermediates

**RaytracingOutputBuffer (renamed from ICLOutputDriver):**

Thread-safe double-buffered image capture. Cycles' render thread writes; GUI reads.
- Two `Img8u` buffers alternate. Write always targets `1 - frontIdx` (never the
  buffer the GUI is currently reading)
- After capture, publishes new front buffer under mutex
- Before writing, checks `isIndependent()` on target buffer. If a previous
  `getImage()` caller still holds a shallow copy (use_count > 1), calls `detach()`
  to allocate fresh channel storage (rare fallback path)
- `getImage()` returns stable `const Img8u&` to front buffer
- `setBatchDoneCallback(cb)` — management thread wires this to its CV for
  batch-completion notifications

**Raytracer interface expanded:**
- Added `setDenoising(bool)` to virtual interface (was CyclesRenderer-only)

**Overlay viewer simplified:**
- Removed custom `OverlayCallback` struct and `GLImageRenderer bgRenderer`
- Uses `scene.getGLCallback(0)` for the GL overlay rendering
- Sets Cycles image as widget background via `gui["canvas"] = Image(rtImg)` in
  `run()` — enables image info indicator, pixel query, zoom
- `handleMouse` only calls `invalidateAll()` on drag/release (not every event)
- Initial params set in `init()` before `start()` to avoid setter/default mismatch
- Denoising disabled for interactive preview (fast noisy intermediates)

**Key lessons learned during debugging:**
1. **Denoiser hides noise** — with denoising on, even 1-sample images look clean.
   Must disable for interactive preview where the user expects to see progressive
   noise reduction.
2. **Setters must check equality** before calling `markDirty()`. Without guards,
   `run()` firing at 30fps continuously restarts the renderer.
3. **Mouse events fire at system rate (~60Hz)**, not at FPS limiter rate. Without
   the "don't interrupt mid-batch" design, camera drag events starve the renderer.
4. **Qt paint cycle timing** — (Session 16: sleep removed. Multiple batches per paint
   cycle is fine — user just sees a less noisy image.)
5. **Double-buffer must write to non-front** — the original post-publish buffer
   selection could detach the just-published front buffer, corrupting displayed data.

### Next Steps

**Performance:**
- **Fast camera-only sync path** — skip full `sync.synchronize()` when only the
  camera changed. Just update the Cycles camera and reset the render buffer.
- **Consider adaptive samplesPerStep** — start with 1 during drag (responsive),
  increase to 4-8 after drag stops (faster convergence)
- **Denoising toggle** — enable denoising only after N samples for final quality,
  keep off during interactive preview

**Other:**
- **Refactor cycles-scene-viewer.cpp** — replace inline setupScene/decimateMesh
  with `SceneSetup.h` calls
- ~~**Zoom viewport**~~ — Session 17: both 2D (UV crop) and 3D (projection crop matrix)
  zoom fully fixed. Works at any zoom level, any AR, no oversized FBOs.

## Previous State (Session 13 — GLImageRenderer, Overlay Viewer, SceneSetup)

### Session 13 Summary

**GLImageRenderer moved to ICLQt + replaces GLImg for widget background images:**
- New `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/GLImageRenderer.h/.cpp` — shader-based image renderer that
  replaces GLImg's legacy `glPixelTransfer`/`draw2D` rendering pipeline.
- Features: image storage (deep copy), BCI via shader uniforms (`uBCIScale`/`uBCIBias`),
  pixel query, statistics, scale mode (nearest/linear), grid state, letterbox scaling.
- `ICLWidget::Data::image` changed from `GLImg` to `GLImageRenderer`.
- **Core Profile background images now work:** `gui["canvas"] = img` renders the image
  as background before the GL callback (was missing — known limitation fixed).
- Legacy path also uses GLImageRenderer (replaces `GLImg::draw2D`).
- Both paths use `glViewport(imageRect)` → `render()` → restore viewport.
- Thread safety: `std::recursive_mutex` guards `storedImage` in GLImageRenderer —
  `update()` runs from worker thread, `getColor()`/`getStats()` from GUI thread.
- GLImg kept for OSD button icons (legacy path only) and DrawWidget/GLPaintEngine 3D
  texture uses. Can be fully deprecated later.

**SceneRendererGL — widget-aware zoom + overlay mode:**
- Widget-aware `render(scene, camIndex, widget)` overload reads zoom state from widget.
- Refactored: core rendering extracted to `renderWithViewport(scene, camIndex, vpX, vpY, vpW, vpH)`.
- **Overlay mode** (`setOverlayMode(true)` + `setOverlayAlpha(float)`):
  - Clears to transparent (0,0,0,0), skips sky rendering
  - Replaces `glBlitFramebuffer` with alpha-blended textured quad from SSR FBO
  - Blit shader: `FragColor = vec4(c.rgb, c.a * uAlpha)` with `GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`
  - Reuses skyVAO for the fullscreen blit quad
- Old GLImageRenderer implementation removed from SceneRendererGL.cpp.
  Backwards-compat alias: `icl::geom::GLImageRenderer = icl::qt::GLImageRenderer`.

**SceneSetup utility (`src/Raytracing/SceneSetup.h/.cpp`):**
- `setupScene()` — free function extracted from cycles-scene-viewer.cpp (~290 lines).
  Handles: file loading (OBJ/glTF), mesh decimation, transform baking, user rotation,
  auto-scaling to 400mm, checkerboard ground, 3-point lighting with shadows, camera
  creation, sky/environment. Returns `SceneSetupResult` with object/material ownership.
- `applyMaterialPreset()` — 10 presets (original, clay, mirror, gold, copper, chrome,
  red plastic, green rubber, glass, emissive).
- Both functions part of `icl::rt` namespace in ICLRaytracing library.

**New overlay viewer (`demos/cycles-overlay-viewer.cpp`):**
- Single Canvas3D pane compositing Cycles (background) + GL (overlay).
- `gui["canvas"] = img` sets Cycles image as background (works via new GLImageRenderer).
- GL callback renders SceneRendererGL in overlay mode on top.
- Alpha slider controls GL overlay opacity (0-100%).
- Material combo, bounces, exposure controls.
- Uses SceneSetup for scene loading.

**Files created:**
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/GLImageRenderer.h/.cpp` — merged GLImg+renderer
- `ICLExperimental/Raytracing/src/Raytracing/SceneSetup.h/.cpp` — shared setup
- `ICLExperimental/Raytracing/demos/cycles-overlay-viewer.cpp` — overlay app

**Files modified:**
- `ICLQt/src/ICLQt/Widget.cpp` — GLImg→GLImageRenderer, Core Profile bg images
- `ICLGeom/src/ICLGeom/SceneRendererGL.h` — removed GLImageRenderer, added overlay API
- `ICLGeom/src/ICLGeom/SceneRendererGL.cpp` — removed GLImageRenderer impl, added
  overlay mode (transparent clear, skip sky, alpha-blended blit), blit shader
- `ICLExperimental/Raytracing/demos/cycles-scene-viewer.cpp` — widget-aware callbacks
- `ICLExperimental/Raytracing/CMakeLists.txt` — SceneSetup source, overlay target

## Previous State (Session 12 — Glass/Transmission + Widget Overlay Port)

### Session 12 Summary

**Glass/Transmission support (Cycles + GL):**
- `Material.h`: added `transmission`, `ior`, `attenuationColor`, `attenuationDistance`,
  `thicknessFactor` fields + `isTransmissive()` query
- `GltfLoader.cpp`: reads `KHR_materials_transmission`, `KHR_materials_ior`,
  `KHR_materials_volume` extensions from glTF (cgltf parses them automatically)
- Cycles: uses `MixClosure(PrincipledBsdf, GlassBsdf)` instead of PrincipledBsdf's
  built-in `transmission_weight`. This is necessary because glTF spec defines transmission
  roughness as always 0 (smooth), but Cycles' PrincipledBsdf applies surface roughness
  to transmission uniformly. The MixClosure gives a separate GlassBsdf(roughness=0) for
  the transmission lobe. Volume absorption via AbsorptionVolumeNode wired for materials
  with finite attenuationDistance.
- **Important finding:** `bsdf->set_transmission_weight()` direct setter did NOT work
  for SVM compilation. Must use ValueNode graph connections instead. However, with the
  MixClosure approach, the PrincipledBsdf transmission_weight is not used at all.
- GL renderer: two-pass rendering (opaque then back-to-front transparent with alpha
  blending). Fragment shader computes Fresnel-based alpha from IOR, tints with
  attenuation color. Transmissive objects skipped in shadow pass.

**Scene viewer improvements:**
- Always normalize scenes to 400mm extent (removed conditional 10-10000 guard)
- Bake glTF node transforms into vertices before scaling/rotation — fixes models
  with nested hierarchies (ToyCar) where local-vs-world mismatch caused zoom issues
- Lower ground plane slightly to avoid z-fighting with model-embedded floors
- Simplified GUI: removed GL Env%/Direct% tuning sliders, split controls into two rows
- Added `-backlight` flag: emissive panel behind scene for testing transmission
- Added material debug logging in GltfLoader

**SSR improvement:**
- Normalize ray to fixed screen-space length (prevents far-distance overshooting)
- Depth-adaptive thickness (`baseThickness + depth² * 0.01`)
- 64 linear + 6 binary refinement steps (was 48 + 4)

**Test scenes added:**
- `scenes/ToyCar.glb` — glass windshield, chrome, glossy paint
- `scenes/TransmissionTest.glb` — grid of clear→frosted glass spheres
- `scenes/TransmissionRoughnessTest.glb` — transmission × roughness matrix
- `scenes/DragonAttenuation.glb` — colored crystal with volume absorption
- `scenes/MosquitoInAmber.glb` — amber resin block with insect inside
- `scenes/MetalRoughSpheres.glb` — PBR calibration grid
- `scenes/basic-shapes.obj` — sphere, box, cylinder for SSR/material testing

**Widget overlay ported to Core Profile:**
- Created `QPainterPaintEngine` implementing `PaintEngine` interface via QPainter
- Two-phase rendering in `paintGL()`: Phase 1 runs GL callback (3D), Phase 2 creates
  QPainter on the widget for all 2D overlay (OSD buttons, tooltips, zoom rect, info)
- `DrawWidget3D::customPaintEvent()` splits GL phase (e==nullptr) and 2D phase
  (e!=nullptr) for Core Profile
- OSD buttons render via `drawWithPaintEngine()` using `PaintEngine::image()`
- `ImageInfoIndicator::paint()` accepts `PaintEngine*` instead of `GLPaintEngine*`

### Verified working:
- ToyCar: green-tinted glass windshield visible in both Cycles and GL
- MosquitoInAmber: amber block transmissive in both (mosquito visible with backlight)
- OSD buttons, tooltips, image info visible in Core Profile
- Zoom rect drawing works during drag
- All test scenes load, auto-scale, and render correctly

## Previous State (Session 11 — GL/Cycles Parity + Screen-Space Reflections)

### What Was Built (Session 8)

Replaced the custom raytracing backends with Blender Cycles. Built a full
interactive rendering pipeline: non-blocking progressive rendering state machine,
physics demo with real-time object spawning, scene viewer with OBJ/glTF loading,
material presets, checkerboard ground, 4-point lighting, and mesh decimation.

### Key Design Decisions (Session 5)

**Virtual post-processing stages:**
- `applyDenoisingStage()`, `applyToneMappingStage()`, `applyUpsamplingStage()` are
  virtual methods in the base class. Default: CPU fallback. Metal backend overrides
  for GPU-native paths.
- `supportsNativeDenoising()` / `supportsNativeToneMapping()` / `supportsNativeUpscaling()`
  let the UI/orchestrator query capabilities at runtime.
- Pipeline order: raytrace → denoise → tone map → upscale → readback.

**SVGF temporal design:**
- The path tracer does its own temporal accumulation (running average over N frames).
- SVGF does NOT blend colors temporally — it passes the accumulated color through
  unchanged. It only tracks luminance moments (mean, mean²) across frames for
  per-pixel variance estimation.
- The spatial filter uses this variance to adapt edge-stopping weights (σ_lum scales
  with √variance), giving better quality than plain À-Trous.
- Mesh ID edge-stopping: hard `continue` for neighbors with different object IDs
  prevents silhouette halos from path tracing jitter at object boundaries.

**Reflectivity-aware denoising:**
- Per-pixel `mat.reflectivity` output from raytrace kernels.
- Spatial filter weight scaled by `(1-refl)²` — mirrors get minimal spatial blur.
- Applied in both GPU and CPU SVGF implementations.

**Emissive area light sampling:**
- `RTEmissiveTriangle` list built during scene extraction with world-space vertices,
  smooth averaged vertex normals (not cross-product face normals), and triangle area.
- One random triangle per bounce, area-weighted selection, uniform barycentric point.
- Shadow ray: `max_distance = dist - 1.0` to avoid self-intersection.
- Geometric term: `NdotL * lightNdotL * totalEmissiveArea / dist²`.

**Tone mapping:**
- Reinhard, ACES filmic (Narkowicz 2015), Hable/Uncharted 2 curves.
- Exposure multiplier applied before the curve.
- No gamma correction (raytracer output is already in display space).
- Metal GPU kernel operates in-place on float buffers.

**XML scene loader:**
- Composable: `render-offline -scene base.xml objects.xml` merges files.
  First camera wins, lights/objects accumulate.
- Supports: camera, lights (with scale), cube/sphere objects with color,
  reflectivity, shininess, emission, rotation, scale.
- Uses ICL's pugixml wrapper (`ICLUtils/XML.h`).

### Bugs Fixed (Session 5)

1. **MetalFX RG16Float** — pixel format constant was 102, correct value is 105
2. **MetalFX Temporal depth format** — requires `Depth32Float` (252), not `R32Float`
3. **MetalFX Temporal jitter** — Halton jitter must be applied to camera rays before
   dispatch, not just reported to the scaler
4. **1D kernel dispatch** — u8ToFloat/floatToU8/toneMap kernels changed from 1D (n,1)
   to 2D (w,h) dispatch with uint2 tid (1D caused all-black on some configs)
5. **SVGF + tone mapping crash** — SVGF temporal buffers need separate size tracking
   (svgfW/H) from shared denoise ping-pong buffers (denoiseW/H)
6. **Tone mapping gamma** — removed incorrect pow(1/2.2) gamma; output is already
   display-space
7. **SVGF double accumulation** — path tracer accumulates, SVGF passes color through;
   only tracks variance temporally
8. **Silhouette halo** — mesh ID edge-stopping in spatial filter prevents color bleeding
   across object boundaries from path tracing jitter
9. **Emissive shadow artifacts** — use averaged smooth vertex normals instead of
   cross-product face normals for emissive triangles

### Material System (Session 6)

**Phase 1 — Material class + SceneObject integration:**
- `ICLGeom/src/ICLGeom/Material.h/.cpp` — PBR `Material` class with `baseColor`,
  `metallic`, `roughness`, `reflectivity`, `emissive`, texture map slots
  (`baseColorMap`, `normalMap`, `metallicRoughnessMap`, `emissiveMap` as
  `shared_ptr<ImgBase>`), alpha mode, display hints. Static factories
  `fromColor()`, `fromPhong()`, plus `toPhongParams()` for GL fallback.
- `Primitive.h` — `shared_ptr<Material> material` on base Primitive struct
- `SceneObject.h/.cpp` — `m_defaultMaterial`, `setMaterial()`/`getMaterial()` API,
  `getOrCreateMaterial()`. Old `setColor`/`setShininess`/`setSpecularReflectance`/
  `setReflectivity`/`setEmission` deprecated with `[[deprecated]]` — still work,
  auto-sync to material.

**Phase 2 — Raytracer PBR shading:**
- `RTMaterial` updated: `baseColor`, `emissive`, `metallic`, `roughness`,
  `reflectivity` (replaces diffuseColor/specularColor/shininess)
- `GeometryExtractor` reads from Material class when available, legacy fallback
- Cook-Torrance microfacet BRDF (GGX + Smith + Schlick Fresnel) in all three
  backends: CPU, Metal, OpenCL. Energy-conserving Lambert diffuse for dielectrics,
  zero diffuse for metals.

**Phase 3 — OpenGL renderer adaptation:**
- `Scene::renderSceneObjectRecursive()` uses `Material::toPhongParams()` for GL state
- Per-primitive material override in render loop (set/restore GL specular/shininess)

**Phase 4 — Texture support:**
- `Material` stores textures as `shared_ptr<core::ImgBase>` (portable, no Qt dep)
- `RTVertex` extended with `float u, v` (UV coordinates)
- `SceneObject` gets `m_texCoords` vector, `addTexCoord()`/`getTexCoords()`
- `GeometryExtractor` flows UVs through: from per-vertex texCoords, or generates
  (0,0)→(1,1) for TexturePrimitive quads
- `RaytracerBackend::setMaterialTextures()` virtual passes Material pointers
- CPU backend samples all four texture maps at hit UVs:
  - `baseColorMap` → modulates albedo
  - `metallicRoughnessMap` → overrides metallic (R) and roughness (G)
  - `normalMap` → perturbs shading normal via tangent-space transform
  - `emissiveMap` → modulates emission
- GPU texture sampling deferred (Metal/OpenCL need texture upload infrastructure)

**Key design decisions (Session 6):**
- Texture images stored as `ImgBase` (not `GLImg`) for portability across backends
- PBR↔Phong conversion in both directions preserves visual appearance
- Deprecated API auto-creates Material on first use via `getOrCreateMaterial()`
- Per-primitive material override: primitive's material > object's material > legacy
- Normal map uses constructed tangent frame from shading normal (no explicit tangents)

### Session 6 additional improvements

- **Roughness-aware SVGF denoising** — roughness passed through G-buffer alongside
  reflectivity. Spatial filter scales neighbor weights by `roughness²`: smooth
  surfaces get almost no blur (preserves specular highlights), rough surfaces get
  full denoising. Combined with reflectivity via `min(reflScale, roughScale)`.
- **Specular indirect lighting** — path tracer now does MIS between specular and
  diffuse bounces (was diffuse-only). Metals get ~90% specular bounces with
  roughened reflection direction. Fixes metals appearing flat/matte.
- **Brighter sky gradient** — warm horizon (0.6) → blue zenith (0.55), dark below
  horizon. Essential for PBR materials to have something to reflect.
- **Material extraction bug fix** — RTMaterial fields were uninitialized when
  `geomDirty=false`, corrupting all materials on geometry change. Fixed by always
  extracting material via `tessellateExtractMaterial()` + adding default initializers
  to RTMaterial fields.
- **Demo improvements** — PBR material archetypes (roughness gradient, gold, copper,
  plastic, rubber, mirror, emissive), material tooltip on hover, improved physics
  parameters (lower angular damping, initial spin for realistic tumbling).

### Known issues with custom raytracer

The custom Cook-Torrance BRDF implementation has visual quality limitations:
- **Roughness differences barely visible for dielectrics** — F0=0.04 means only 4%
  specular, dwarfed by diffuse. Needs HDR environment maps (not just a sky gradient)
  to show glossy reflections convincingly.
- **Metals look better after specular indirect fix** but still not production quality.
- **Denoiser vs roughness tension** — SVGF spatial filter still erases subtle specular
  differences despite roughness-aware edge-stopping.
- **No importance-sampled GGX** — specular indirect uses roughened reflection
  approximation, not proper GGX importance sampling.

These limitations motivated the decision to integrate Blender Cycles instead.

## Cycles Integration (Session 6 — In Progress)

### Decision

Replace the custom raytracing backends with Blender Cycles as the rendering engine.
Cycles provides production-quality PBR (Principled BSDF), Metal GPU acceleration,
OIDN denoising, environment maps, and 15+ years of battle-tested code.

### Build Status

Cycles standalone is checked out at `3rdparty/cycles/` and builds successfully.
See `3rdparty/cycles/INSTALL_ICL.md` for build instructions.

**Prerequisites (macOS):**
```bash
brew install git-lfs python@3.13
```

**Build:**
```bash
cd 3rdparty/cycles
make update                    # ~1.2 GB precompiled deps via Git LFS
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPYTHON_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13 \
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/libpython3.13.dylib \
  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/include/python3.13
cmake --build . -j16 --target install
```

**Verified:** Metal and CPU devices detected, `install/cycles` executable built.

### Cycles XML Shader Node Issue — FIXED (Session 7)

The standalone `cycles` executable had a **lazy initialization problem**: most
shader node types failed with "Unknown shader node" errors because `NODE_DEFINE`
only registers a node type when `get_node_type()` is explicitly called, but the
XML parser calls `NodeType::find()` which does a plain map lookup. In full Blender,
the UI code constructs every node type (triggering registration); the standalone
never did. **Not a linker issue** — the code was linked, just never called.

**Fix:** Added `xml_register_shader_nodes()` in `src/app/cycles_xml.cpp` — a
bootstrap function that calls `get_node_type()` on all 90 concrete shader node
classes before XML parsing starts. Called at the top of `xml_read_file()`.

**Verified:** All example scenes render correctly — `sky_texture`, `background`,
`checker_texture`, `glass_bsdf`, `noise_texture`, `glossy_bsdf`, `diffuse_bsdf`,
`wave_texture`, `bump`, `emission`, etc. all work.

### Cycles Integration Progress

1. ~~**Fix shader node registration**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7)
2. ~~**Verify full rendering**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7)
3. ~~**CMake + Cycles linking**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — `cycles_target_setup()` helper
4. ~~**CyclesRenderer + SceneSynchronizer**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — full bridge:
   - ICL Scene → Cycles scene (meshes, materials, camera, lights)
   - PrincipledBsdf shader graphs from ICL Material
   - ICL Camera intrinsics → Cycles FOV
   - Per-object dirty tracking for incremental updates
   - OutputDriver → ICL Img8u with sRGB gamma
   - Quality presets (Preview/Interactive/Final)
5. ~~**Delete old infrastructure**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — removed ~9,870 lines
6. ~~**Analytic spheres**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — SceneObject::ObjectType::Sphere
   renders via Cycles PointCloud (perfect ray-sphere intersection, zero faceting)
7. ~~**Camera crash fix**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — removed `cclCam->update()` call
   that caused SIGBUS; Session::reset() handles it. FOV/clip plane clamping added.
8. ~~**Hosek-Wilkie sky**~~ ✓ Done (Session 7) — realistic environment lighting
   via SkyTextureNode, proper light intensity scaling for scene units

### Camera Orientation Issue (IN PROGRESS — Session 7)

The camera orientation conversion from ICL to Cycles is partially working but
has a subtle Y-axis flip problem related to ICL's unconventional `up` vector:

**ICL Camera convention** (from Camera.h docs):
- `norm` = view direction (the direction the camera looks)
- `up` = direction pointing toward **positive image Y**, which is the **bottom**
  of the image (image Y increases downward). This is opposite to most 3D APIs
  where "up" means scene-up / image-top.
- `horiz` = computed as `cross(up, norm)`, forms right-handed system with norm and up

**Current state of syncCamera (SceneSynchronizer.cpp):**
- `camUp = -icl_up` (negated, since ICL up points down)
- `right = cross(forward, camUp)`
- `upVec = cross(right, forward)`
- Cycles transform: `tfm.y = -upVec` (negated Y row)
- OutputDriver: no Y-flip (direct copy)

**What works:** Y-up scenes with `Camera::lookAt()` render correctly
(`cycles-renderer-test` shows spheres on ground, right-side up, correct FOV).

**What doesn't work:** Z-up scenes (physics demo). The camera at
`(600, -500, 400)` looking at `(0, 0, -30)` with `up=(0,0,1)` shows only sky.
The camera orientation math produces a valid-looking matrix but the objects
aren't in the field of view.

**`Camera::lookAt()` factory** (added in Session 7, in Camera.h/.cpp):
- Takes intuitive params: position, target, up, resolution, hfov_degrees
- Computes `norm = normalize(target - position)`
- Computes `imageUp` = component of world-up perpendicular to norm
- Derives `f` and `mx` from desired horizontal FOV
- Sets `principalPointOffset` to image center
- Works for Y-up; untested/broken for Z-up

**Key insight still needed:** The relationship between ICL's `up` vector,
the Cycles Transform rows, and the OutputDriver's Y-flip needs to be resolved
as a single coherent convention. The current approach of individual negations
and flips is fragile. Consider studying how the old GeometryExtractor's
`extractCamera` built the ray generation matrix — it worked for both Y-up
and Z-up scenes. That code is in git history at commit 47ee811d0.

**Debug aids in place:**
- `fprintf(stderr, "[Camera] ...")` prints in syncCamera showing pos, fwd, up,
  fov, near/far, and the full 3x4 transform matrix. Remove when fixed.

### Completed (Session 8)

- ✅ Camera orientation fixed for Y-up and Z-up (horiz, -up, forward as columns)
- ✅ Camera::lookAt documented with ICL's unusual up=visual-down convention
- ✅ Light intensity calibrated (300x multiplier for ICL scene distances)
- ✅ Non-blocking progressive rendering (3-state machine: IDLE→WAIT_FOR_START→RENDERING)
- ✅ tag_update(scene) for transform changes (was tag_tfm_modified which was a no-op)
- ✅ session->start() after every session->reset() (session thread goes idle after completion)
- ✅ Physics demo: time-based spawning, delayed object activation, side-by-side GL view
- ✅ Scene viewer: OBJ loading, auto-scale, checkerboard ground, material presets
- ✅ Vertex clustering mesh decimation (-decimate N)
- ✅ renderBlocking() for offscreen rendering

### Completed (Session 9 — Full Texture Pipeline)

- ✅ **Primitive UV indices** — TrianglePrimitive expanded (6→9 ints), QuadPrimitive (8→12),
  adding per-corner texcoord indices i(6..8) / i(8..11) alongside existing normal indices.
  Mirrors the existing separate-pool pattern for normals. Default -1 = no UV.
- ✅ **Material texture slots → Image** — changed from `shared_ptr<ImgBase>` to `core::Image`
  (value semantics, null by default, check via `operator bool()`)
- ✅ **stb_image texture decoding** — `decodeImage()` in GltfLoader decodes PNG/JPEG from
  embedded GLB buffers or external file references into 4-channel Img8u via `stb_image.h`
- ✅ **UV attributes on Cycles meshes** — `tessellateToMesh()` reads UV indices from
  primitives, writes `ATTR_STD_UV` per-corner float2 data on Cycles mesh
- ✅ **ICLImageLoader** — custom `ccl::ImageLoader` subclass in SceneSynchronizer that
  bridges ICL `Image` to Cycles `ImageManager`. Uses `planarToInterleaved()` for fast
  channel conversion (4-ch path), registered via `add_image(unique_ptr<ImageLoader>)`
- ✅ **Texture nodes in shader graph** — `createPrincipledShader()` creates full node graph:
  - baseColorMap → ImageTextureNode → PrincipledBsdf::Base Color (+ Alpha for cutout)
  - metallicRoughnessMap → ImageTextureNode → SeparateColorNode → Blue→Metallic, Green→Roughness
  - normalMap → ImageTextureNode → NormalMapNode (tangent space) → PrincipledBsdf::Normal
  - emissiveMap → ImageTextureNode → PrincipledBsdf::Emission Color
  - Shared TextureCoordinateNode provides UVs to all texture lookups
- ✅ **Emissive fix** — emissiveFactor always stored (was skipped when texture present),
  emissiveMap decoded and forwarded. Per glTF spec: final = factor * texture.
- ✅ **Emission via PrincipledBsdf** — switched from AddClosure(BSDF+Emission) pattern
  to PrincipledBsdf's built-in emission_color/emission_strength (simpler, correct)
- ✅ **GltfLoader passes UV indices** — when UVs present, vertex index = UV index
  (glTF pre-splits at seams), passed through addTriangle(..., ta, tb, tc)
- ✅ **Verified: DamagedHelmet.glb renders with full PBR textures**

### Session 10 — GL 4.1 Core Profile Renderer Rebuild

**Status: Feature-complete PBR renderer with multi-light shadows, env reflections,
and analytical brightness calibration. Visually close to Cycles (3% overall match
on DamagedHelmet with white background).**

Replaced the GLSL 1.20 compatibility-profile renderer with a full GL 4.1 Core
Profile renderer. Switched the widget GL context via `QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat()`
before `ICLApp` construction. Legacy fixed-function GL calls in `ICLWidget` and
`DrawWidget3D` are guarded with `GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK` checks.

**Completed (Sessions 9-10):**
- ✅ GL 4.1 Core Profile: `#version 410 core`, VAOs, `layout(location=N)`, `in`/`out`
- ✅ Multi-light (8 lights, individually queried uniform locations — NOT `loc+i`)
- ✅ PBR materials: metallic, roughness, emissive, Blinn-Phong specular
- ✅ All texture maps: baseColorMap, normalMap (TBN from dFdx/dFdy),
  metallicRoughnessMap (glTF blue/green), emissiveMap
- ✅ Multi-light shadow mapping: up to 4 shadow maps, per-light shadow cameras,
  `sampler2DShadow` with hardware PCF, `glPolygonOffset` bias
- ✅ Sky gradient background: procedural from inverse VP matrix, shared Sky struct
- ✅ GLImageRenderer: fullscreen textured quad for 2D image display in Core Profile
- ✅ Sky struct (`Sky.h`): Solid/Gradient/Physical/Texture modes, shared between
  GL and Cycles via `Scene::setSky()`/`getSky()`
- ✅ Compare mode (`-compare prefix`): offscreen FBO rendering, 4×4 regional
  brightness grid, per-pixel stats
- ✅ `-background white|black|gradient|physical` CLI flag
- ✅ `-bg` / `-exp` CLI overrides for compare mode
- ✅ `scripts/compare-grid.sh`: validates brightness match across BG%×Exposure% grid
- ✅ Cycles camera FOV fix: pass vertical FOV (not horizontal) to `set_fov()`
- ✅ GL Env % / GL Direct % tuning sliders for real-time calibration

**Completed (Session 11 — GL/Cycles parity + SSR):**
- ✅ **Fixed exposure² bug in GL** — env uniforms no longer include exposure; it's
  applied once at the end to all contributions uniformly
- ✅ **Fixed bgPct² bug in Cycles** — sync formula uses only `sky.intensity`, not
  `m_backgroundStrength` (setBrightness only triggers dirty detection)
- ✅ **Light color normalization** — GL lights normalized from legacy 0-255 to [0,1]
- ✅ **Energy-conserving Fresnel** — roughness-aware Schlick (Lagarde 2014),
  `kD = (1-F)*(1-metallic)` attenuates diffuse where specular is strong
- ✅ **Removed infinite-bounce boost** — the `1/(1-albedoLum)` factor diverged from
  Cycles at low bounce counts and amplified sky color bias. Removed; envMul covers it.
- ✅ **Normal-map self-occlusion** — `dot(N, geomN)` darkens ambient where normals
  are bent away from geometric surface (crevices, borders, chamfered edges)
- ✅ **glTF occlusion map** — added `Material::occlusionMap`, loaded from glTF
  `occlusionTexture`, applied to ambient/env lighting in GL shader
- ✅ **Cycles directional sky gradient** — shader node graph (GeometryNode →
  SeparateXYZ → flipY → pow/mix) replicates GL's `sampleSky()` gradient. Y negated
  for Cycles background convention. bgStrength reduced from 2.0× to 1.0× to match GL.
- ✅ **Screen-space reflections (SSR)** — previous-frame ping-pong FBOs (no extra
  render pass). Fragment shader traces 48 linear + 4 binary refinement steps along
  `reflect(-V, N)` in previous frame's screen space. Confidence fades at screen edges,
  long distances, rough surfaces, and depth thickness. Falls back to sky smoothly.
- ✅ **SSR controls** — checkbox toggle + debug mode 6 (SSR Confidence: green=hit,
  red=fallback) in viewer GUI

**Key design decisions (Session 11):**
- **Linear response everywhere** — both renderers respond linearly to BG% and
  Exposure% changes. A single set of calibration factors works across all settings.
- **sky.intensity as single env knob** — shared between GL and Cycles. Cycles'
  setBrightness() only triggers dirty detection, not used in the formula.
- **SSR inline in geometry shader** — no extra render pass or G-buffer MRT. Fragment
  shader samples read-only previous frame textures. FBO blit to screen after rendering.
- **Depth texture with GL_NONE compare mode** — SSR depth uses `sampler2D` for raw
  depth values (not `sampler2DShadow` like shadow maps).
- **Previous-frame reprojection** — stores `prevViewMatrix`/`prevProjectionMatrix`
  for correct SSR when camera moves. One-frame lag is imperceptible.

**Source layout:**

### Next Steps

#### Completed (Session 13)

- ✅ Widget zoom viewport (SceneRendererGL + callbacks)
- ✅ Background images in Core Profile (GLImageRenderer replaces GLImg::draw2D)
- ✅ SceneRendererGL overlay mode (transparent clear, skip sky, alpha-blended blit)
- ✅ SceneSetup utility (shared scene loading)
- ✅ cycles-overlay-viewer app
- ✅ GL material cache invalidation on material change (texture cache was stale)
- ✅ Overlay viewer GUI: controls on right panel with labeled sliders
- ✅ SceneRendererGL moved into Scene (lazy `getRendererGL()`, GLCallback auto-selects
  Core Profile renderer in `draw()`)
- ✅ `ProgArg::subargs<T>()` — returns all sub-args as `vector<T>`
- ✅ GL 4.1 Core Profile set in ICLApp constructor (all ICL apps get it automatically)
- ✅ Overlay viewer simplified: uses `scene.getGLCallback(0)`, `FPSEstimator`, no manual
  QSurfaceFormat setup

#### Immediate TODO

- ~~**FIX: Overlay viewer crashes**~~ — Session 16: fixed (null outputDriver + DataStore).
- **Refactor cycles-scene-viewer.cpp** — replace inline setupScene/decimateMesh/
  computeSceneBounds/material-switching with `SceneSetup.h` calls. Currently both
  implementations exist (viewer has its own, library has the extracted version).
- ~~**Zoom still buggy**~~ — Session 17: fully fixed (UV crop for 2D, crop matrix for 3D).
- ~~**Test overlay viewer**~~ — Session 17: verified working (compositing, alpha, camera
  sync, material presets, zoom).

#### GL Renderer — Remaining

1. **SSR tuning** — far-distance artifacts remain; revisit step count, thickness,
   and screen-space normalization. Consider adaptive step size.
2. **Volume attenuation in GL** — currently only tints via attenuationColor; doesn't
   model distance-dependent Beer-Lambert absorption

#### Widget — Remaining

3. **DrawWidget ImageCommand** — `ImageCommand` in DrawWidget.cpp uses `GLImg::draw2D()`
   directly. In Core Profile, needs migration to GLImageRenderer or PaintEngine.
4. **Fully deprecate GLImg** — remaining uses: OSD button icons (legacy), DrawWidget
   ImageCommand, GLPaintEngine image rendering. Migrate each to GLImageRenderer.
5. **Grid overlay** — GLImageRenderer stores grid state but drawing is not implemented
   yet. Add grid line drawing in QPainter overlay phase.

#### Legacy Cleanup

6. **Delete legacy renderer** — `Scene::renderSceneObjectRecursive()`, `ShaderUtil`,
   display lists, all `glBegin/glEnd` code
7. **Wire `Scene::getGLCallback()`** to SceneRendererGL for all ICL apps

#### Cycles — Deferred

- HDR environment maps (Sky::Texture mode)
- Area/spot/sun light types
- Volume attenuation for colored glass
- QEM mesh decimation
- Cycles XML scene loader

### Known Limitations

- SSR only reflects visible geometry (not behind camera or occluded)
- SSR has one-frame latency on reflections (imperceptible for slow camera motion)
- SSR has artifacts at far distances (screen-space step overshooting)
- Lights created once per session in Cycles (no dynamic updates)
- Only point lights (no spot/area/sun)
- OBJ loader: no MTL material parsing
- PolygonPrimitive doesn't carry UV indices yet
- DrawWidget ImageCommand bypasses PaintEngine in Core Profile
- Cycles `set_transmission_weight()` direct setter doesn't work for SVM compilation;
  must use ValueNode graph connections (or MixClosure approach as implemented)
