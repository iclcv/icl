    /// Xine-based Video Grabber (grabs most common image formats) \ingroup MOVIE_FILE_G
    /** The VideoGrabber implementation differs somehow from other Grabber implementations, as
        video playback is heavily constrained by the current video framerate. The
        VideoGrabber's property interface provides functions to set up the grabbers video playback
        speed.
        Internally video frames are obtained successively (using xine's 'experimental feature:
        framegrab_video_port').

        Currently, drop-frames are not allowed/possible, so if the grabber is too slow to reach the
        desired Video-framerate, playback speed is decreased implicitly

        \section KI Known Issues
        The video grabber does not really work very stable.
        * In particular when linked against
          the default xine build shipped with ubuntu, you will most likely get some seg-faults due
          to a known xine bug.
        * Video streams that have a stream-size whose width is not a multiple of 8, will not be
          displayed correctly due to some undocumented data allignment issues.
        * Some formats just cause seg-faults within 3rd party libs.
        * seeking using setProperty("stream-pos") does not work robustly, however
          it does work in the icl-video-player application

        \section ALT Alternative
        Please note, that the OpenCVVideoGrabber might be an alternative for you
