    ///  File Writer implementation writing images to the hard disc \ingroup FILEIO_G
    /** \section OVERVIEW Overview
        The implementation has been re-designed to provide a structured more flexible
        plugin based interface for writing images using most different file formats.
        Currently the following formats are supported:
        - <b>ppm</b> (8 Bit 3-channel interleaved color image core::format - 24Bit per pixel )
          multi channel images must have a channel count which is a multiple of 3. The
          original channel information is encoded into the header. Other image viewers
          will show e.g. a 6 channel image as a default 3 channel image where the channels
          3,4 and 5 are put <b>under</b> the channels 0, 1 and 2 (<b>vertical extended</b>)
        - <b>pgm</b> ( 8 Bit mono core::format ) Multi channel images are written by a vertical
          of the image
        - <b>pnm</b> on of ppm or pgm (the viewer or grabber will determine the actual format
          by parsing the first line of the image file
        - <b>icl</b> icl file core::format . For best compatibility the icl core::format includes a header
          which is denoted by trailing '#' characters and which determines the images
          parameters. In the data section, the channel-data is put planar into the file
          channel by channel. Apart from the ".csv"-core::format, the ICL core::format is the only
          core::format, which provides different data types (in particular floats and doubles).
        - <b>csv</b> Comma Separated Values core::format. To provide a convenient interface to
          math-programs as gnuplot, matlab or maple this core::format can be use. In contrast
          to all the other formats, the csv-core::format is <em>human readable</em>, which means,
          that each value is written as ASCII text.
        - <b>jpg</b> Format of the <b>J</b>oint <b>P</b>hotographic <b>E</b>xperts <b>G</b>roup.
          Loss-full compressed image core::format (libjpeg required and -DWITH_JPEG_SUPPORT must be
          defined, which is performed automatically by the makefile system)
        - <b>bicl</b> ICL's built-in binary core::format. This core::format does also support loading
          and saving of image meta data
        - <b>rle1</b> for run-length encoded binary images (best core::format for low-noise
          binary images, does also support writing and reading of image meta data)
        - <b>rle4,rle6,rle8</b> for non-binary images with run-length encoding (other than this,
          as rle1
        - <b>jicl</b> only supported with jpeg support, like bicl, but with jpeg compressed
          image data (jpeg compression is set to 70%, does also support saving meta data).


        \section ZLIB Z-Lib support
          All supported file formats (except jpg) can be written/read as gzipped file. This
          feature is available if the libz is found by the makefile system, which automatically
          defines the -DWITH_ZLIB_SUPPORT then. To write a file with zip compression, you
          just have to add an additional ".gz"-suffix to the file name.

        \section SPEED IO-Speed
          Dependent on the particular core::format, the IO process needs a larger or smaller
          amount of time. The following table shows a summary of the I/O Times. The times
          are taken on a 1.6GHz pentium-m notebook, so the actual times may fluctuate:

        <table>
        <tr> <td>          </td>  <td><b>Writing (gz)</b></td>  <td><b>Reading (gz)</b></td>  <td><b>File-utils::Size (640x480-Parrot) (gz)</b></td></tr>

        \section EX Example
        The following example illustrates using the file writer:
        \code

        #include <ICLIO/FileWriter.h>
        #include <ICLQt/Quick.h>

        int main(){
           // create an image
           icl::core::Img8u a = cvt8u(scale(create("parrot"),640,480));

           // create the file writer
           icl::io::FileWriter writer("image_####.jpg");

           // write the file
           writer.write(&a);
        }
        \endcode
    **/
    class ICLIO_API FileWriter : public ImageOutput{
      public:
      /// initializer class
      friend class FileWriterPluginMapInitializer;

      /// creates an empty file writer
      FileWriter();

      /// Creates a new filewriter with given filepattern
      /** @param filepattern this string is passed to the member FilenameGenerator
                 @see FilenameGenerator
      **/
      FileWriter(const std::string &filepattern);

      /// Creates a new FileWriter with given FilenameGenerator
      FileWriter(const FilenameGenerator &gen);

      /// Destructor
      ~FileWriter();

      /// returns the wrapped filename generator reference
      const FilenameGenerator &getFilenameGenerator() const;

      /// writes the next image
      void write(const core::ImgBase *image);

      /// wraps write to implement ImageOutput interface
      virtual void send(const core::ImgBase *image) { write(image); }

      /// as write but in stream manner
      FileWriter &operator<<(const core::ImgBase *image);

      /// sets a core::format specific option
      /** currently allowed options are:
          - "jpg:quality"  values of type int in range [0,100]
          - "csv:extend-file-name" value of type bool ("true" or "false")
      **/
      void setOption(const std::string &option, const std::string &value);

      private:
      /// internal generator for new filenames
      FilenameGenerator m_oGen;

      /// static map of writer plugins
      static std::map<std::string,FileWriterPlugin*> s_mapPlugins;
    };

  } // namespace io
