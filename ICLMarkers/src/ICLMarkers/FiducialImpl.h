    /// Hidden implemetation for fiduical classes
    /** The FiducialImpl class works as data storage for the public
        Fiducial class. It also holds a back-reference to it's parent
        FiducialDetectorPlugin that is used to compute features
        on demand if not alread available

        \section DEV Developers
        The FiduicalImpl should not be visible for the FiduicalDetector user
        who accesses Fiducial information via the public Fiduical class.
        The Fiduical class implementation contains smart methods for
        querying Fiducial-Features. If a feature has been computed once,
        further calls will just return the automatically buffered result.

        \section PP Precomputed vs. Deferred Feature Extraction
        The feature Extraction is implemented in the FiducialDetectorPlugin
        class that defines
        * how Fiducials are detected
        * what features are supported
        * how certain features are computed.

        The FiducialDetectorPlugin <b>can</b> initialize the FiduicalImpl instances
        with precomputed values. Most of the time, at least some of the
        Fiducial feature values are already estimated within the detection step.
        If e.g. a region based fiducial detector needs to estimate a regions 2D-center
        for the detection itself, it can initialize the FiducialInstances with
        these values. Of course, it has to set up the 'computed' mask in the
        FiduicalImpl instances according to the set of precomputed features.\n
        Other features, that are supported, but perhaps more difficult to compute
        can in contrast be supported in a deferred manner. The FiducialDetectorPlugin
        will the leave the 'computed' mask empty for this feature and provide
        an appropriate getter-method implementation. This is in particular useful
        to speed up the detection step itself since usually most complex features
        dont have to be computed for each detected Fiducial.
