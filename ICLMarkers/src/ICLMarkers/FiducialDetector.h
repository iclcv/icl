          - "art"
            for ARToolkit markers (visit the
            <a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/">ARToolkit Webpage</a>
            for more details)
            ART Fiducials can provide the full set of information including the 3D pose
            from a single marker
          - "bch"
            for ARToolkit+/Studierstube-Tracker like bch-code based binary markers
            (visit the <a href="http://studierstube.icg.tugraz.at/handheld_ar/stbtracker.php">
            Studierstube Tracker Homepage</a> for more details)
            BCH Fiducials can provide the full set of information including the 3D pose
            from a single marker. Usually, the detection rate is faster and more accurate
            in comparison to artoolkit markers.
          - "amoeba"
            for The amoeba style hierarchical markers provided by the
            <a href="http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/">reactivision software</a>
            Amoeba fiducials cannot be detected in 3D. They do only provide 2D center and
            rotation and the 2D boundary.
          - "icl1"
            for ICL's own markers, that were also used for the former version of
            deformable paper tracking. Here, 32 hierarchical markers are provided. These markers
            do also provide key-point association and 3D pose estimation. all allowed marker IDs
            can be used twice: positive IDs indicate 'normal' markers (with a black root region)
            while negative marker IDs indicate 'inverted' markers (with white root regions)

          <b>other parameters</b>\n
          For extraction of 3D marker information, usually a camera
          is needed. The camera can also set later using setCamera
          Even though the camera is passed per pointer, it is
          compied deeply into the FiducialDetector instance. The
          camera can be updated using setCamera() lateron\n
          The also optionally given markersToLoad and params
          are directly passed to the loadMarkers method

            Please note that angular braces define a range, while curly
            braces define a list here.\n
            Artoolkit markers need extra param in the param list which is the real marker size (in mm)
            An example param list is <tt>ParamList("size",utils::Size(50,50));</tt>

            converted into an appropriate matching representation
          - "amoeba"\n
            Each amoeba marker is represented by a special two-level hierarchical
            code representation that is wrapped by the TwoLevelRegionStructure class.
            You can pass either a file, that contains a list of these codes (one code per line)
            or a single code or a comma- or space separated list of codes. Please note
            that the "amoeba" markers are only free to use in combination with the
            <a href="http://reactivision.sourceforge.net">reacTIVision</a> software.
          - "icl1"\n
            These are the 32 allowed icl1 marker IDs: 1294  1252  1287  1035  1245  993  1292

            but can be added in a more genereal list. E.g. by adding which ="[450-1300]", you can
            add all markers. Actually if you load a marker ID x, also the inverted marker
            (that has a white root-region) with ID -x is added.

          * <b>art</b> needs a float valued 'border ratio' parameter. This is used to compute the border size
            for a given marker image. If the marker image (without border) has size A^2, then
            whole marker image (whith borders) has size (1+'border ratio')*A. Only finally, the image is scaled
            to it's destination size.
