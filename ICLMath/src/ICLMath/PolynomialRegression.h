    /** Polynomial regression applies least square regression 
        based on a polynomial that is computed on the input variables.
        It minimized p(x) a = y, for a given polynomial function p(x).
        x can be a scalar of a vector. The same is true for y. Each
        entry of x and y resp. is assued to be one row of the input
        matrices xs and ys.
        
        \section RES Result 

        The resulting PolynomialRegression::Result instance can be
        used to compute the output of the a given set of input variables
        simultaneously. It contains the optimal solution of a, which
        is used to compute y = p(x) a.


        \section FUNC The Polynomial Function definition
        
        The PolynomialRegression class uses a rather very simple but intuitive
        syntax for the definition of the used polynomial. Here is an
        example that contains all allowed parts: "1 + x0 + x1 + x0*x1 + x1^2 + x2^2"
        White spaces are ignored; tokens are defined by the "+"-delimiter.
        Tokens can be of form 
        - K, where K is a constant (can be float, however actually only "1" makes sence here)
        - xI, where I is an integer input variable index
        - xI*xJ*... , where I and J and other are integer input varialbe indices
        - xI^K, where K is a constant (can be float and int)
